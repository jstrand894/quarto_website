Data for each field site was averaged from three of the closest weather stations to that location. Data was plotted using R Studio (R Studio version 2024.04.0+735, R 2024) package 'ggplot' (version 3.4.4) [@ggplot]. Data was then fit using a linear model using the 'lm' command using average yearly precipitation (inches) as the response variable and year as the predictor.\n\n*NDVI analysis.* We compared the relative greening throughout the growing season between wheat fields and adjacent *B. inermis* using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is typically used to assess vegetation health and density, and is calculated from the visible and near-infared light reflected by vegetation [@Pettorelli2005]. Data was downloaded using Google Earth Engine (Google Inc. 2023, Mountain View, CA, USA).\n\n### Controlled *C. cinctus* infestation of *B. inermis*\n\n*Insects and Cages.* Assessment of *C. cinctus* infestation and mortality within *B. inermis* were assessed using a 34 x 60 ft plot at the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38'19.39\"N, 116°14'28.86\"W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. The cage structure was built using 1-inch PVC piping with the netting made using 530$\\mu$ Amber Lumite Screen (BioQuip$^\\circledR$ Products, LLC). Twelve cages were built to dimensions of 6ft x 3ft x 3ft (L x W x H) with cage locations selected randomly based on the space available within the plot and arranged in sets of three.\n\nWheat stem stubble was collected in Three Forks, MT, USA (43°38'19.39\"N, 116°14'28.86\"W) from fields that experienced high levels of *C. cinctus* infestation and cutting the year prior. Cut stubble, which contained *C. cinctus* larvae in diapause, were kept refrigerated between -2°C and 3°C for \\>100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Once *B. inermis* stems reached six inches tall, stub containers with emerging sawflies were added to cages to mimic sawfly infestation pressure. Sawfly quantity treatments were as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).\n\n*Data Collection.* In late August, *B. inermis* stems were collected from each cage. Each stem was sliced open using X-Acto® knives to collect data on infestation, dead larvae, live larvae, and parasitism at each internode.\n\n### Montana Field Survey\n\n*Stem collection and processing.* We conducted a field survey to assess *C. cinctus* infestation, larval mortality, and *B. cephi* and *B. lissogaster* prevalence within *B. inermis* and adjacent wheat fields. Sites were chosen across 2 counties in north-central Montana, United States. (Chouteau, Judith Basin), which consistently experience high *C. cinctus* pressure. Samples were collected from wheat fields and adjacent *B. inermis* in early July and late August in 2021, 2022, and 2023 from sites in Big Sandy, Moccasin, and Amsterdam, MT, USA. Sampling sites were set up as 100$m^2$ polygons along the edge of adjoining wheat fields. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly selected within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected using a shovel to remove both stem and root material. Wheat stems were collected at distances of 5 and 20 meters from the edge of the field. Samples were collected in 4 rows at 10 meters apart. 2 samples were collected in each row at distances of 5 and 20 meters. 1 ft samples were collected at each point.\n\nWheat and *B. inermis* stems were then returned to Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana and stored in a 10°C cold wet storage until dissection. Stems were dissected lengthwise with a fine-bladed scalpel to determine presence or absence of *C. cinctus* larvae infestation, live eggs, dead eggs, dead larvae, live larvae, parasitism, and cutting. Sawfly larvae were identified based on descriptions in Criddle (1915) and Wallace and McNeal (1996).\n\n*Statistical Analysis.* We used generalized linear mixed models with binomial errors (logit link) fit using bound optimization by quadratic approximation, with a maximum of 200,000 iterations, were run in the *lme4* package in R [@lme4] to examine the effects of location and year (fixed effects) on each of the three response variables: proportion of stems infested, proportion of stems cut, and proportion os stems parasitized by *Bracon* spp. '\n\nTo better understand the density of *Bracon* spp. within the wheat and *B. inermis* sampling sites, we converted our units to the ratio of parasitoids to stem per unit area. Densities of stems are different when considering *B. inermis* and cultivated wheat or barley. Using this conversion, we attempted to better understand how the density of parasitoids (and WSS) is changed by looking at each kind of plant.\n\n## Results\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Historical Weather Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe observed a significant linear relationship (*r = 0.1, P = 0.033, estimate = -0.058*) between average precipitation and year for both Big Sandy and Moccasin, Montana.
