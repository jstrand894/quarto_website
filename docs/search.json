Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. The cage structure was built using 1-inch PVC piping with the netting made using 530() Amber Lumite Screen (BioQuip® Products, LLC). Twelve cages were built to dimensions of 6ft x 3ft x 3ft (L x W x H) with cage locations selected randomly based on the space available within the plot and arranged in sets of three. The cages were removed from the plot after 3 weeks of sawfly release.\n\n\nInsects\nWheat stem stubble was collected in Three Forks, MT, USA (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W) from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation and cutting in the prior year. Cut stubble, which contained C. cinctus larvae in diapause, were kept refrigerated between -2°C and 3°C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Stubs were added to cages once B. inermis stems reached six inches tall, with sawfly quantity treatments as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).\n\nData Collection\nStems were collected from each cage site in late August. All stems from each 6 x 3 ft cage section were collected. Each stem was sliced open using X-Acto® knives to collect data on infestation, dead larvae, live larvae, and parasitism at each internode.",

Using this information we can make an arguement about the size and length of time each larvae was alive prior to dying. This can be informative in understanding how many larvae would have been left later in the season for potential parasitism.\n\n\nInfestation Percentage/Node\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Table\n\n\n\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF-Value\nPr(&gt;F)\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n1\n0.044\n0.044\n6.692\n0.0144\n\n\nnodes.inf\n5\n0.286\n0.057\n8.612\n0.0000\n\n\nv.r\n2\n0.057\n0.029\n4.303\n0.0221\n\n\nResiduals\n32\n0.213\n0.007\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the results of our ANOVA, we have weak evidence (Pval = 0.0221) to suggest there is a difference in the number of nodes infested when considering treatment group and vegetative and reproductive stems.\n\n\n\n\nCumulative sum of nodes infested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# of Nodes Infested\n\n\n\nTreatment\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\nhigh\n0.01\n0.13\n0.36\n0.69\n0.89\n1\n\n\nlow\n0.03\n0.13\n0.47\n0.76\n0.94\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this plot because it shows the cumulative percentage sum of nodes infested at each node. For example, at the 3rd node in 2023, we see that close to 70% of the stems in the ‘high’ treatment group exhibited between 3 and 6 nodes infested. As a general thought exercise, the more nodes a larvae burrowed through, the larger the larvae. This means that if we classify a “large” larvae as one who burrowed through at least 4 nodes, our infestation data shows that 36% of the larvae in the ‘high’ treatment groups died as “large” larvae.\n\n\n\n\nStems with Living Larvae (2023)\n\n\nTreatment\nCount\nTotal Stems\n%\n\n\n\n\nhigh\n26\n421\n0.062\n\n\nlow\n35\n415\n0.084\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting to see that 6.2% of stems in the ‘high’ treatment groups and 8.4% of stems in the ‘low’ treatment group had living WSS larvae. The stems for this experiement were harvested in late October, much later in the season when we would expect the second generation parasitoids to be searching for a host.",

    "text": "Data Collection\n\nField Volatile Collection\nVolatile collected was undergone on plants grown at a 34 x 60 ft plot at the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. Plants were inventoried and logged using GPS, and tissue samples from each specimen were analyzed to establish whether the plant contained the endophyte. Volatiles were collected from all the plants in each year over the course of one to two successive weeks.\nVolatile were collected from 20 plants per day by placing Reynolds Turkey Oven Bags (Reynolds Group Holdings, Auckland, New Zealand) over the top of the selected number of leaflets.\n\n\nGreenhouse Volatile Collection\nSamples of each plant were first sent for analysis to mystery lab to see if endophyte was present or not. Volatile compounds were collected from healthy (size/stage) locoweed plants. Plants were paired based on size similarity, with one being E+ and the other E-. Three sets of pairs (twelve plants) were used for each volatile collection event. Collection was undergone for a period of six hours from 09:00 to 15:00.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Image Gallery\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\nGreenhouse Volatile Collection Plants looked like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Volatiles were collected from twleve plants per day using glass volatile collection chambers (VCCs) that were 30 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. The top end of each VCC funneled into a threaded port that was 10 cm in daimter. Threaded onto the top of each VCC was an eight-port “octopus” manifold adapter. Two glass filter traps (6.35 mm diameter x 76 mm length; Analytical Research Systems, Gainesville, FL) with 30 mg of Super-Q absorbent (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) were inserted into two of the adapter ports. The remaining six collection ports were sealed to prevent ambient air exchange and pressure loss. One of the traps was used to collected extraneous volatiles from the initial experiment set up for the first ten minutes, whereas the other trap was used to collect volatile compounds emanating from plants beginning ten minutes after the system was turned on. An air source was connected to the base of each collection chamber with supply from charcoal air filters. A vacuum pump was used to maintain air pressure and flow rate (humidified air at 1.0 liter/min) within the collection system. A small piece of cotton encompassed by a Teflon® guillotine was used at the base of each plant to tightly seal the base of the system and prevent external air from entering. Laboratory tape was used to seal the edges of the guillotine and prevent contamination by ambient and soil derived volatiles.\nVolatile collection and successive GC-MS analysis were conducted following methods described in Weaver et al. (2009). After the six hour collection period, glass volatile collection traps were eluted using 200 µL of dichloromethane into 2 mL screw top vials (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), followed by a slow release of nitrogen to further clear the volatile trap. 10 µL of nonyl acetate solution was added to the eluted solution as internal standard to quantify compounds. Samples were then subject to gas chromatography (GC) on a J&W HP – 5ms; 30m x 0.25 µm film thickness column (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The GC unit (Agilent 6890; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was paired with a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent 5973 instrument). Samples were injected into the column in pulse splitless mode, with the initial pressure of 82.7 kPa/m.",

Statistical analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team 2024) using RStudio (version 4.2.1) using PERMANOVA, PERMDISP, and Random Forest modeling. The data was first transformed using a center log-ratio (CLR) transformation, a technique commonly used when analyzing multivariate compositional data (Brückner and Heethoff 2017). VOC compositions were compared between samples and treatments using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, Canberra distance, 999 iterations) tests implemented in the vegan package (v 2.6-4) (Oksanen et al. 2011). This technique uses permutation testing to generate many different rearrangements of the data to assess if the observed differences are statistically significant (Anderson 2017). Data were visualized using a combination of ggplot2 and knitr (Wickham 2016; Xie 2021). I selected a subset of comounds to ues for each analysis. These compounds were seelcted based on consistency of presence across samples and years, as well as overall quality of mass spectroscopy output. I will highlight the cmopounds that I used for each analysis as I get to them.",

Sample locations were chosen by identifying fields with consistent wheat production that were adjacent to healthy B. inermis stands, either situated between fields or between fields and roadways. Polygons containing B. inermis were set up along the periphery of adjacent wheat fields, each covering an area of approximately 100 meters. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly selected within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected.

The data was first transformed using a center log-ratio (CLR) transformation, a technique commonly used when analyzing multivariate compositional data (Brückner and Heethoff 2017). VOC compositions were compared between samples and treatments using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, Canberra distance, 999 iterations) tests implemented in the vegan package (v 2.6-4) (Oksanen et al. 2011). This technique uses permutation testing to generate many different rearrangements of the data to assess if the observed differences are statistically significant (Anderson 2017). Data were visualized using a combination of ggplot2 and knitr (Wickham 2016; Xie 2021). I selected a subset of comounds to ues for each analysis. These compounds were seelcted based on consistency of presence across samples and years, as well as overall quality of mass spectroscopy output. I will highlight the cmopounds that I used for each analysis as I get to them.\n\n\n\n\nToadflax Type PERMANOVA\n\n\n\nDf\nSumOfSqs\nR2\nF\nPr(&gt;F)\n\n\n\n\nmeta_data$type\n3\n1.173032\n0.2591062\n12.00709\n0.001\n\n\nResidual\n103\n3.354192\n0.7408938\nNA\nNA\n\n\nTotal\n106\n4.527223\n1.0000000\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur results show strong evidence (p-val = 0.001) of a difference between our four plant types (YT, DT, Synthetic, and Natural)\nLet’s look to see if there are differences between\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, Marti J. 2017. “Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA).” In Wiley StatsRef: Statistics Reference Online, 1–15.
