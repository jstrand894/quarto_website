    "text": "To assess C. cinctus infestation, larval mortality, and parasitoid prevalence within B. inermis and adjacent wheat fields, sites were chosen that had the best chance of accurately representing conditions throughout the Golden Triangle, a region of north-central Montana known for its dryland grain production. Samples were collected in early July and late August in 2021, 2022, and 2023 from sites in Big Sandy, Moccasin, and Amsterdam, MT, USA. B. inermis sites were set up as polygons along the edge of adjoining wheat fields measuring approximately 100 meters in area. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly partitioned within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected. The stems were then processed and split in the laboratory to assess infestation, live eggs, dead eggs, dead larvae, live larvae, parasitism, and cutting.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of C. cinctus infestation and mortality within B. inermis were assessed using a 34 x 60 ft plot at the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. The cage structure was built using 1-inch PVC piping with the netting made using 530\\(\\mu\\) Amber Lumite Screen (BioQuip\\(^\\circledR\\) Products, LLC). Twelve cages were built to dimensions of 6ft x 3ft x 3ft (L x W x H) with cage locations selected randomly based on the space available within the plot and arranged in sets of three. The cages were removed from the plot after 3 weeks of sawfly release.\n\n\n\nWheat stem stubble was collected in Three Forks, MT, USA (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W) from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation and cutting the year prior. Cut stubble, which contained C. cinctus larvae in diapause, were kept refrigerated between -2°C and 3°C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Stubs were added to cages once B. inermis stems reached six inches tall, with sawfly quantity treatments as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).\n\n\n\nStems were collected from each cage site in late August. All stems from each 6 x 3 ft cage section were collected. Each stem was sliced open using X-Acto® knives to collect data on infestation, dead larvae, live larvae, and parasitism at each internode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWheat stubble collected the year prior to each experiment were used to rear adult WSS. Wheat stubble was collected from Big Sandy (48.17754°N, -110.11406°E) and Three Forks (46.020216°N, -111.586582°E), MT, USA. Stubble was collected from fields that experienced high levels of WSS infestation and cutting the year prior. Cut stubble, which contained WSS larvae in diapause, were kept in a refrigerator between 0-4 °C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. After completing diapause, immature WSS were kept at room temperature between 22-27 °C for 4-5 weeks in sealed 70 cm x 35 cm x 20 cm plastic Tupperware\\(^\\circledR\\) bins to allow for pupation and emergence. Once emergence began, adults were collected daily and sorted in 2-liter glass mason jars sealed with filter paper to allow for airflow. Jars containing adults were refrigerated at 6-10°C until they were needed for experiments. Unused adults were discarded after 48 hours of refrigeration.\n\n\n\nSmooth brome was grown from transplanted stems harvested from the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. Immediately following collection, stems were transplanted into 2.7 x 14 inch lightweight deepot cells (Stuewe & Sons Inc\\(^\\circledR\\), Tangent, OR). Winter wheat plants were grown using Yellowstone Winter Wheat cultivar seed stock, started in 1 x 8 inch conical pots. The soil used consisted of MSU Plant Growth Center soil mix (equal parts sterilized Bozeman silt loam soil and washed concrete sand with Canadian sphagnum peat moss incorporated) and Sunshine Mix 1 (Canadian sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite, perlite, and Dolomite lime) in a 1:1 ratio. Fertilization was undergone once weekly using Jack’s Professional\\(^\\circledR\\) Water-Soluble Fertilizer (20-20-20) (J.R. Peters Inc., Allentown, PA, USA). The plants were kept in a greenhouse in the Montana State University Plant Growth Center using supplemental light from model MVR1000/C/U GE Multi-Vapor Lamps (GE Lighting, General Electric Company, Cleveland, OH) under photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h at 22 \\(\\pm\\) 2°C and 20 – 40 % RH. After the plants reached Zadoks 12, they were moved into vernalization storage for 6 weeks to experience the length of dormancy needed for successful flower development. After the six-week period, wheat stems were transplanted into the larger, 2.7 x 14-inch Stuewe & Sons, Inc\\(^\\circledR\\) conical pots.\n\n\n\nWinter wheat plants were deemed ready for infestation once they reached Zadoks 49. Both smooth brome and winter wheat plants were infested by placing a transparent plastic cylinder (60 x 3.8 cm) over the main stem of the plant. A 55-60 cm bamboo stick was added within each tube to help prevent toppling of the cylinder. Each cage had three holes, as well as an open top, covered with fine mesh cloth to allow for air circulation. Four females and two male WSS, newly emerged, were introduced into each tube via a small 1 cm opening. After which, the hole was plugged using a cotton ball covered in mesh cloth. Damp soil was mounded around the base of each tube to prevent insect escapees. Adult sawflies were left within infestation tubes for three days, after which the tubes were removed, and any surviving insects, as well as cadavers, were removed. After infestation, the plants were returned to normal water and fertilization schedules.\nInfestation was undertaken three days a week, for five weeks. Each replicate included 6 ‘Yellowstone’ winter wheat plants at Zadoks 49 and 6 smooth brome plants exhibiting three nodes. For each replicate, three wheat and three smooth brome plants were infested, with three of each left uninfested. Infestation tubes were placed around all twelve plants to maintain control.\n\n\n\nVolatile compounds were collected from intact and healthy smooth brome and Yellowstone winter wheat. Collection was undergone on plants at Zadoks 49, for a period of six hours from 09:00 to 15:00. Collections were undergone three times a week, with twelve plants collected from each time. Each trial consisted of six smooth brome plants and six winter wheat, with four of each being infested, while the other two were controls.\nVolatiles were collected from twelve plants per day using glass VCC’s that were 80 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. The top end of each VCC funneled into a threaded port that was 10 cm in diameter. Threaded onto the top of each VCC was an eight-port manifold adapter. Two glass filters (traps) (6.35 mm diameter x 76 mm length; Analytical Research Systems, Gainesville, FL) with 30 mg of Super-Q absorbent (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) were inserted into two of the adapter ports. The remaining six collection ports were sealed to prevent ambient air exchange and pressure loss. One of the traps was used to collected extraneous volatiles from the initial experiment set up for the first ten minutes, whereas the other trap was used to collect volatile compounds emanating from plants beginning ten minutes after the system was turned on. An air source was connected to the base of each collection chamber with supply from charcoal air filters. A vacuum pump was used to maintain air pressure and flow rate (humidified air at 1.0 liter/min) within the collection system. A small piece of cotton encompassed by a Teflon® guillotine was used at the base of each plant to tightly seal the base of the system and prevent external air from entering. Laboratory tape was used to seal the edges of the guillotine and prevent contamination by ambient and soil derived volatiles.\n\n\n\nVolatile compounds were eluted from the glass traps using 200 \\(\\mu\\)L aliquot dichloromethane. Trapped volatiles were eluted slowly by adding dichloromethane and further clearing by using a slow release of nitrogen gas. The eluted samples were collected in a glass insert held within a 1.5-mL crimped top glass vial. 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of nonyl acetate were then added to the eluted samples as internal standard to quantify compound concentrations. The samples were processed using gas chromatography (GC) on a HP – 5MS; 30m x 0.25mm, 0.25 \\(\\mu\\)m film thickness column; (J and W Scientific, Folsom, CA). In order to analyze, the GC instrument (Agilent 6890; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent 5973 instrument). Each sample was injected using the automated system in pulse splitless mode, with the initial pressure set to 82.7 kPa per minute. The inlet temperature of the GC was set to 250°C while the column temperature was 50°C for 4 minutes. The temperature was set to increase at a rate of 5°C per minute until it reached 160°C, after which it increased to a rate of 25°C per minute until it reached 280°C. The temperature of the transfer line leading to the mass selective detector (MSD) was set at 300°C. Helium was used as a carrier gas to maintain the flow rate of samples within the column at 1.2 mL/min. The MSD was set in ‘SCAN’ mode running from 50 – 300 m/z.\n\n\n\nThe compounds collected from both the smooth brome and wheat samples were identified by comparing mass spectra and retention times using the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) library. Peaks and volatiles were analyzed using MSD ChemStation (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The data obtained from the mass-spectrometer was transferred to a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet where the compounds were quantified by comparison with the internal standard peak area. The amount obtained for each compound was then transformed to the amount produced in six hours. The true quantity of compounds was calculated relative to the internal standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParasitoids B. cephi and B. lissogaster were collected from wheat fields in Three Forks, MT (46.020216° N, -111.586582° E). Wheat stem residue from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation were collected and stored inside 170-liter plastic barrel liners. Filled liners were stored in a cold storage room at 4°C until mid or late spring of the following year. After the storage time exceeded the mandatory duration needed for obligatory diapause, the plastic barrel liner was removed from cold storage and the residue was placed inside 170 L trash barrels at room temperature and watered to encourage emergence. Collected parasitoids were kept at 6-10°C until used.\n\n\n\nSpecimens were prepared by excising the head from the body using fine micro-dissection scissors. For each specimen, a micro-capillarity tube was pulled in half using a pipette puller (Model PP-830, Narishige Scientific Instrument Lab, Tokyo, Japan). Each half was cut to the appropriate length and angle, then filled with saline solution. The parasitoid head was mounted on the broken end of one of the capillary tubes, then the tube was place on one of the conducting electrode wires connected to a micromanipulator, type INR-5 (Narishige MN-151). The second half of the capillary tube was place on the other electrode wire, and one insect antennae was positioned to touch the empty capillary tube, thus connecting the circuit. The amplifier transferred the information to a computer interface with an EAG version 2.7 software (Syntech NL 2001, Hilversum, Netherlands). This apparatus and method has been consistently used previously in assessing insect volatile response [@Agelopoulos1999].\nA consistent stream of purified, humidified air (20 mL sec-1) was delivered onto the antennae. The test compound was delivered via airborne stimulus released from a glass pipette with filter paper treated with 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of the test compound. The pipette was connected to a Stimulus Controller CS-55 (Syntech NL 2010, Hilversum, The Netherlands). The equipment was programmed to deliver a 0.4 second puff of air through a Teflon tube and through the glass pipette. The electrical response of the antenna to the test compound was detected by the recording electrode and transferred to the amplifier, increasing the signal and delivering the information to the computer. Figure 2: Electroantennogram connected to GCMS. Useful for connecting insect electrochemical response to host plant produced volatile compounds.\n\n\n\nY-tube bioassays were conducted within the chemical ecology and insect behavior laboratory at the Plant Growth Center at Montana State University. Bioassays were undergone to determine behavioral choice preference response of individual female WSS to an air stream containing volatiles originating from smooth brome and a blank control. Bioassays were conducted using plants at growth stage Zadoks 49. The Y-tube system (Analytical Research Systems, Micanopy, FL) used was similar as described in a previous study [@Daisy2002] (Figure 1). A single plant was enclosed in a volatile collection chamber (VCC) (100 mm diameter, 254 mm length). Input air was charcoal-filtered and humidified, regulated by a diaphragm air pump that delivered air at a rate of 0.2 L min-1. Air was moved into the VCC through Teflon tubing connected with a 24/410 threaded glass joint. The bottom end of the VCC enclosed each plant and was tightly sealed by a Teflon guillotine (diameter 955 mm, 15 mm center opening), encircling the stem to prevent air leakage. The olfactory system used a Y-shaped glass tube that had two arms connected to the lower port of each VCC by Teflon tubing (diameter 0.64 cm), providing the airstream source from the plant. The VCC contained plant was illuminated by an enhanced spectrum LED grow light (sunshine Systems Grow UFO Light SS-Gu90w, Led Lighting4 Less, Paradise, CA) for one hour before the experiment to make the plant photosynthetically active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Cropping Example\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Figure 1: Y-tube olfactory bioassay as constructed by Daisy et al. (2002). Used to measure insect behavior in the presence of volatile stimulus.\n\n\n\n\nThe Y-tube was made of bifurcated Corning® glass, measuring in at 28-mm diameter x 300 m length. The Y shape branched at an angle of 120, with each branch serving as an arm of the olfactometer. The stem of each Y-tube was 20 cm long. At the bifurcation, each branch extended 4 cm from the junction before ending in 10 cm parallel arms. The Y-tube was positioned horizontally inside a black box made of poster board (46 x 32 x 101.5 cm), designed to prevent the entry of unwanted ambient light. The black box had two holes on the upstream sie of the olfactometer, allowing a fiber optic illuminator (T-Q/FOI-1, Techni Quip Corp, El Segundo, CA) and Teflon tubing to pass through. The fiber optic illuminator was used to deliver light to both arms equally from the center of the bifurcation, while the Teflon tubing connected the VCC to the arms of the Y-tube. One arm of the Y-tube delivered volatiles from the enclosed plant while the other delivered filtered, pure air as a control. The movement of adult WSS is positively phototactic and the horizontally placed Y-tube was positioned such that the light distribution towards both arms was balanced to avoid bias. The arms of the Y-tube were oriented to minimize directional bias and the position of the plants was alternated between runs.\nFor each assay, a single naïve female B. cephi or B. lissogaster parasitoid was introduced 1 cm into the unbranched end of the Y-tube. A 28-cm wire was used to facilitate parasitoid movement from the unbranched stem of the glass Y-tube to the test junction between the two upper arms. The order of individual test insects from a pool of naive females was randomly assigned for each bioassay, and test plants were chosen randomly from the greenhouse culture before each experiment. All glassware was cleaned using dish soap and warm water, followed by solvent rinses with acetone and hexane. Cleaned and rinsed glassware was baked at 110°C in a glassware oven for 24 hours before use. New plants were used for each experiment.\nEach individual parasitoid was allowed three minutes to respond to either air stream source. Once a positive response was determined to either source, the trail was ended. If no choice was made after five minutes, the trail was ended and the result was recorded as no response."

    "text": "Wheat stubble collected the year prior to each experiment were used to rear adult WSS. Wheat stubble was collected from Big Sandy (48.17754°N, -110.11406°E) and Three Forks (46.020216°N, -111.586582°E), MT, USA. Stubble was collected from fields that experienced high levels of WSS infestation and cutting the year prior. Cut stubble, which contained WSS larvae in diapause, were kept in a refrigerator between 0-4 °C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. After completing diapause, immature WSS were kept at room temperature between 22-27 °C for 4-5 weeks in sealed 70 cm x 35 cm x 20 cm plastic Tupperware\\(^\\circledR\\) bins to allow for pupation and emergence. Once emergence began, adults were collected daily and sorted in 2-liter glass mason jars sealed with filter paper to allow for airflow. Jars containing adults were refrigerated at 6-10°C until they were needed for experiments. Unused adults were discarded after 48 hours of refrigeration.\n\n\n\nSmooth brome was grown from transplanted stems harvested from the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. Immediately following collection, stems were transplanted into 2.7 x 14 inch lightweight deepot cells (Stuewe & Sons Inc\\(^\\circledR\\), Tangent, OR). Winter wheat plants were grown using Yellowstone Winter Wheat cultivar seed stock, started in 1 x 8 inch conical pots. The soil used consisted of MSU Plant Growth Center soil mix (equal parts sterilized Bozeman silt loam soil and washed concrete sand with Canadian sphagnum peat moss incorporated) and Sunshine Mix 1 (Canadian sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite, perlite, and Dolomite lime) in a 1:1 ratio. Fertilization was undergone once weekly using Jack’s Professional\\(^\\circledR\\) Water-Soluble Fertilizer (20-20-20) (J.R. Peters Inc., Allentown, PA, USA). The plants were kept in a greenhouse in the Montana State University Plant Growth Center using supplemental light from model MVR1000/C/U GE Multi-Vapor Lamps (GE Lighting, General Electric Company, Cleveland, OH) under photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h at 22 \\(\\pm\\) 2°C and 20 – 40 % RH. After the plants reached Zadoks 12, they were moved into vernalization storage for 6 weeks to experience the length of dormancy needed for successful flower development. After the six-week period, wheat stems were transplanted into the larger, 2.7 x 14-inch Stuewe & Sons, Inc\\(^\\circledR\\) conical pots.\n\n\n\nWinter wheat plants were deemed ready for infestation once they reached Zadoks 49. Both smooth brome and winter wheat plants were infested by placing a transparent plastic cylinder (60 x 3.8 cm) over the main stem of the plant. A 55-60 cm bamboo stick was added within each tube to help prevent toppling of the cylinder. Each cage had three holes, as well as an open top, covered with fine mesh cloth to allow for air circulation. Four females and two male WSS, newly emerged, were introduced into each tube via a small 1 cm opening. After which, the hole was plugged using a cotton ball covered in mesh cloth. Damp soil was mounded around the base of each tube to prevent insect escapees. Adult sawflies were left within infestation tubes for three days, after which the tubes were removed, and any surviving insects, as well as cadavers, were removed. After infestation, the plants were returned to normal water and fertilization schedules.\nInfestation was undertaken three days a week, for five weeks. Each replicate included 6 ‘Yellowstone’ winter wheat plants at Zadoks 49 and 6 smooth brome plants exhibiting three nodes. For each replicate, three wheat and three smooth brome plants were infested, with three of each left uninfested. Infestation tubes were placed around all twelve plants to maintain control.\n\n\n\nVolatile compounds were collected from intact and healthy smooth brome and Yellowstone winter wheat. Collection was undergone on plants at Zadoks 49, for a period of six hours from 09:00 to 15:00. Collections were undergone three times a week, with twelve plants collected from each time. Each trial consisted of six smooth brome plants and six winter wheat, with four of each being infested, while the other two were controls.\nVolatiles were collected from twelve plants per day using glass VCC’s that were 80 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. The top end of each VCC funneled into a threaded port that was 10 cm in diameter. Threaded onto the top of each VCC was an eight-port manifold adapter. Two glass filters (traps) (6.35 mm diameter x 76 mm length; Analytical Research Systems, Gainesville, FL) with 30 mg of Super-Q absorbent (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) were inserted into two of the adapter ports. The remaining six collection ports were sealed to prevent ambient air exchange and pressure loss. One of the traps was used to collected extraneous volatiles from the initial experiment set up for the first ten minutes, whereas the other trap was used to collect volatile compounds emanating from plants beginning ten minutes after the system was turned on. An air source was connected to the base of each collection chamber with supply from charcoal air filters. A vacuum pump was used to maintain air pressure and flow rate (humidified air at 1.0 liter/min) within the collection system. A small piece of cotton encompassed by a Teflon® guillotine was used at the base of each plant to tightly seal the base of the system and prevent external air from entering. Laboratory tape was used to seal the edges of the guillotine and prevent contamination by ambient and soil derived volatiles.\n\n\n\nVolatile compounds were eluted from the glass traps using 200 \\(\\mu\\)L aliquot dichloromethane. Trapped volatiles were eluted slowly by adding dichloromethane and further clearing by using a slow release of nitrogen gas. The eluted samples were collected in a glass insert held within a 1.5-mL crimped top glass vial. 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of nonyl acetate were then added to the eluted samples as internal standard to quantify compound concentrations. The samples were processed using gas chromatography (GC) on a HP – 5MS; 30m x 0.25mm, 0.25 \\(\\mu\\)m film thickness column; (J and W Scientific, Folsom, CA). In order to analyze, the GC instrument (Agilent 6890; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent 5973 instrument). Each sample was injected using the automated system in pulse splitless mode, with the initial pressure set to 82.7 kPa per minute. The inlet temperature of the GC was set to 250°C while the column temperature was 50°C for 4 minutes. The temperature was set to increase at a rate of 5°C per minute until it reached 160°C, after which it increased to a rate of 25°C per minute until it reached 280°C. The temperature of the transfer line leading to the mass selective detector (MSD) was set at 300°C. Helium was used as a carrier gas to maintain the flow rate of samples within the column at 1.2 mL/min. The MSD was set in ‘SCAN’ mode running from 50 – 300 m/z.\n\n\n\nThe compounds collected from both the smooth brome and wheat samples were identified by comparing mass spectra and retention times using the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) library. Peaks and volatiles were analyzed using MSD ChemStation (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The data obtained from the mass-spectrometer was transferred to a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet where the compounds were quantified by comparison with the internal standard peak area. The amount obtained for each compound was then transformed to the amount produced in six hours. The true quantity of compounds was calculated relative to the internal standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParasitoids B. cephi and B. lissogaster were collected from wheat fields in Three Forks, MT (46.020216° N, -111.586582° E). Wheat stem residue from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation were collected and stored inside 170-liter plastic barrel liners. Filled liners were stored in a cold storage room at 4°C until mid or late spring of the following year. After the storage time exceeded the mandatory duration needed for obligatory diapause, the plastic barrel liner was removed from cold storage and the residue was placed inside 170 L trash barrels at room temperature and watered to encourage emergence. Collected parasitoids were kept at 6-10°C until used.\n\n\n\nSpecimens were prepared by excising the head from the body using fine micro-dissection scissors. For each specimen, a micro-capillarity tube was pulled in half using a pipette puller (Model PP-830, Narishige Scientific Instrument Lab, Tokyo, Japan). Each half was cut to the appropriate length and angle, then filled with saline solution. The parasitoid head was mounted on the broken end of one of the capillary tubes, then the tube was place on one of the conducting electrode wires connected to a micromanipulator, type INR-5 (Narishige MN-151). The second half of the capillary tube was place on the other electrode wire, and one insect antennae was positioned to touch the empty capillary tube, thus connecting the circuit. The amplifier transferred the information to a computer interface with an EAG version 2.7 software (Syntech NL 2001, Hilversum, Netherlands). This apparatus and method has been consistently used previously in assessing insect volatile response [@Agelopoulos1999].\nA consistent stream of purified, humidified air (20 mL sec-1) was delivered onto the antennae. The test compound was delivered via airborne stimulus released from a glass pipette with filter paper treated with 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of the test compound. The pipette was connected to a Stimulus Controller CS-55 (Syntech NL 2010, Hilversum, The Netherlands). The equipment was programmed to deliver a 0.4 second puff of air through a Teflon tube and through the glass pipette. The electrical response of the antenna to the test compound was detected by the recording electrode and transferred to the amplifier, increasing the signal and delivering the information to the computer.

Useful for connecting insect electrochemical response to host plant produced volatile compounds.\n\n\n\nY-tube bioassays were conducted within the chemical ecology and insect behavior laboratory at the Plant Growth Center at Montana State University. Bioassays were undergone to determine behavioral choice preference response of individual female WSS to an air stream containing volatiles originating from smooth brome and a blank control. Bioassays were conducted using plants at growth stage Zadoks 49. The Y-tube system (Analytical Research Systems, Micanopy, FL) used was similar as described in a previous study [@Daisy2002] (Figure 1). A single plant was enclosed in a volatile collection chamber (VCC) (100 mm diameter, 254 mm length). Input air was charcoal-filtered and humidified, regulated by a diaphragm air pump that delivered air at a rate of 0.2 L min-1. Air was moved into the VCC through Teflon tubing connected with a 24/410 threaded glass joint. The bottom end of the VCC enclosed each plant and was tightly sealed by a Teflon guillotine (diameter 955 mm, 15 mm center opening), encircling the stem to prevent air leakage. The olfactory system used a Y-shaped glass tube that had two arms connected to the lower port of each VCC by Teflon tubing (diameter 0.64 cm), providing the airstream source from the plant. The VCC contained plant was illuminated by an enhanced spectrum LED grow light (sunshine Systems Grow UFO Light SS-Gu90w, Led Lighting4 Less, Paradise, CA) for one hour before the experiment to make the plant photosynthetically active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Cropping Example\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Figure 1: Y-tube olfactory bioassay as constructed by Daisy et al. (2002). Used to measure insect behavior in the presence of volatile stimulus.\n\n\n\n\nThe Y-tube was made of bifurcated Corning® glass, measuring in at 28-mm diameter x 300 m length. The Y shape branched at an angle of 120, with each branch serving as an arm of the olfactometer. The stem of each Y-tube was 20 cm long. At the bifurcation, each branch extended 4 cm from the junction before ending in 10 cm parallel arms. The Y-tube was positioned horizontally inside a black box made of poster board (46 x 32 x 101.5 cm), designed to prevent the entry of unwanted ambient light. The black box had two holes on the upstream sie of the olfactometer, allowing a fiber optic illuminator (T-Q/FOI-1, Techni Quip Corp, El Segundo, CA) and Teflon tubing to pass through. The fiber optic illuminator was used to deliver light to both arms equally from the center of the bifurcation, while the Teflon tubing connected the VCC to the arms of the Y-tube. One arm of the Y-tube delivered volatiles from the enclosed plant while the other delivered filtered, pure air as a control. The movement of adult WSS is positively phototactic and the horizontally placed Y-tube was positioned such that the light distribution towards both arms was balanced to avoid bias. The arms of the Y-tube were oriented to minimize directional bias and the position of the plants was alternated between runs.\nFor each assay, a single naïve female B. cephi or B. lissogaster parasitoid was introduced 1 cm into the unbranched end of the Y-tube. A 28-cm wire was used to facilitate parasitoid movement from the unbranched stem of the glass Y-tube to the test junction between the two upper arms. The order of individual test insects from a pool of naive females was randomly assigned for each bioassay, and test plants were chosen randomly from the greenhouse culture before each experiment. All glassware was cleaned using dish soap and warm water, followed by solvent rinses with acetone and hexane. Cleaned and rinsed glassware was baked at 110°C in a glassware oven for 24 hours before use. New plants were used for each experiment.\nEach individual parasitoid was allowed three minutes to respond to either air stream source. Once a positive response was determined to either source, the trail was ended. If no choice was made after five minutes, the trail was ended and the result was recorded as no response."

Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster are native WSS parasitoids important in managing WSS outbreaks and damage. Smooth Brome (Bromus inermis) grass has been found to be an effective parasitoid sink, and potential trap crop, when grown in areas surrounding wheat fields in Montana. As climate changes continue to alter central and northern Montana, WSS will continue to cause immense damage to dry-land cereal crop yields. My study observes the utilization of smooth brome in providing year-over-year host refuge for Bracon spp. We measured the WSS larval survival rate within controlled smooth brome plots, observing a maximum end-of-year survival of 5.7%. We also collected stems from central and northern Montana where we measured the WSS infestation and parasitoid prevalence within cultivated wheat and adjacent smooth brome. Montana fields sites showed similar high year-end WSS larval mortality while showcasing high levels of parasitism. This research underlines the importance of providing a sustainable ecological buffer for WSS parasitoids as climate conditions continue to change.",

    "text": "Introduction\nEcologists and farmers frequently hold divergent views regarding the importance of natural habitats within agricultural landscapes, a distinction often overlooked in ecological and conservation discourse (Tscharntke et al. 2016). While ecologists recognize the role of natural habitats in supporting biodiversity and providing potential ecosystem services like biological pest control, many farmers perceive these habitat remnants as occupying valuable cropland or even as sources of pests. As such, documenting how pest and natural enemy populations interact with agricultural landscapes alongside natural habitat buffers is important in determining the degree of the services or disservices provided.\nNumerous polyphagous insect herbivores and their natural enemies rely on a variety of resources found across diverse habitat types within their environment. Depending upon the quality of the resource, different habitat types can serve as sources for increased pest or natural enemy populations. Similarly, these habitat types can serve as sinks that decrease populations (Kennedy and Storer 2000). Altering the presence of these resources can have impacts on pest or natural enemy populations and can alter the ecology between the examined species. For example, diversifying the edge cropping of organic Brassica using fava beans, fennel, and marigolds results in a diversity in beneficial arthropod communities that help reduce phytophagous herbivory (Morais et al. 2023).\nUnderstanding the ways in which landscape habitat diversity impacts the ecological relationship between pest and enemy is crucial for effectively managing pest species in large scale cropping systems. Similarly, understanding how herbivore plant-hosts act as reservoirs for pests or beneficial natural enemies can potentially play a role in stabilizing year-over-year agricultural impact from these pests (Cano et al. 2022).\nThe wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Hymenoptera Cephus cinctus Norton, is a grass-mining sawfly native to North America (Lesieur et al. 2016). Originally adept at utilizing wild grass hosts, the species became a major pest to cultivated cereals as the practice became more prevalent following European settlement, becoming a notable pest of winter wheat in 1990 (Morrill and Kushnak 1996). Adult female WSS use their saw-like ovipositor to lay their eggs in the lumen of stems, where the eggs hatch, leading to larval feeding of parenchyma tissue (Holmes and Farstad 1956). Economic damage manifests in the form of both kernel weight reduction caused by tissue damage (Beres et al. 2011) and stem toppling due to late-season larval girdling (Holmes and Peterson 1960).\nSeveral parsitoid species attack C. cinctus within wild grass hosts (Davis et al. 1955, Morrill et al. 1998), however, two species, Bracon cephis (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), have been observed targeting WSS within cultivated cereals (Nelson and Farstad 1953, Morrill et al. 1998). These two host-specific ectoparasitoids are native to North America. Both parasitoids are bivoltine, with the first generation present in Montana from late-June to late-July, while the second generation is active from mid-July to September (Somsen and Luginbill 1956). Adult female B. cephi and B. lissogaster paralyze C. cinctus larvae within the host stem, paralyze the host larvae, and depositing one (B. cephi) to three (B. lissogaster) eggs. B. cephi and B. lissogaster have been shown to provide biological control via irreplaceable mortality of C. cinctus populations (Buteler et al. 2015) and can significantly reduce C. cinctus damage and impact on crop yields (Buteler et al. 2008, Rand et al. 2020). While C. cinctus has a wide range of viable host plants, including native and non-native grasses and cultivated row-crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) (Wallace and McNeal 1966, Cockrell et al. 2017), infestation levels can vary widely across hosts. Previous research has shown preference for host plants with larger stem diameter (Ainslie 1920, Bhandari 2020).\nRecent research has shown natural non-cultivated grasses such as Agropyron cristatum, B. inermis, Elymus trachycaulus, and Elytrigia intermedium host C. cinctus and Bracon spp. parasitoids quite well (Peirce et al. 2021, Rand et al. 2024). We find investigating B. inermis holds the most potential, as it has been shown to be a quality initially-accepted host for C. cinctus oviposition while also leading to high larval mortality later on (Farstad and Jacobson 1945). However, there is a lack of refined data relating to the total infestation, cutting, and parasitization within B. inermis at multiple time points throughout the growing season. Quantitative assessment of potential ‘reservoire’ characteristics and local spatial information could prove useful in fully understanding the ecological impacts of maintaining B. inermis along roadways and within coulees.\nSmooth brome (Bromus inermis Lyess) is a Eurasian cool-season rhizomatous grass introduced to the United States in 1884 (Salesman2011?).B. inermis was originally thought of as potentially useful as a trap crop in order to combat the growing WSS problem with cultural control practices (Farstad and Jacobson 1945). Due to its low agricultural value, and propensity to form monocultures and out compete many native grasses, B. inermis is categorized as invasive in some habitats (Carlson and Newell 1985, Willson and Stubbendieck 2000, Dillemuth et al. 2008). However, B. inermis still holds considerable ecological value in its late senescence and WSS antibiosis properties (Otfinowski et al. 2006, Rand et al. 2024).\nMontana’s golden triangle, an area of central and northern Montana with intense cereal grain production, is prone to drought and burning via wildfire (Wilson 1923). As both C. cinctus and its host-specific parasitoids are relatively restricted in their annual mobility (Weaver et al. 2005), environmental extremes can have broad impacts on both local pest and natural enemy populations. As with many predator-prey interactions, the C. cinctus and parasitoid populations fluctuate, with crashes and spikes experienced in close succession. Similar examples can be found in wolves and moose on Isle Royale (Peterson 1999), and Coccinellidae and aphids (Evans 1999).\nWe examined historical weather data from two field sites in central and northern Montana. We used this data to understand how changes in global climate trends may be impacting B. cephis and B. inermis populations. In addition we analyzed normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) at our field sites to understand how B. inermis senescence patterns compare to adjacent cultivated wheat.\nIn this study, we explored the ecological patterns between Montana populations of C. cinctus and its braconid parasitoids in relation to B. inermis host sites. Our goal, was 1) to understand the degree to which C. cinctus infested B. inermis stems in relation to neighboring cereal crops, and 2) the way in which braconid parasitoids utilized WSS hosts within B. inermis stems. To do so, we conducted two separate studies. In our first study, we conducted controlled C. cinctus infestation of B. inermis to understand the relative infestation and cutting rate of C. cinctus within the B. inermis stems. The second study examined rates of cutting and parasitism at field sites in central and northern Montana.\nUsing these studies, we addressed three questions, 1) what is the total cutting heading into overwinter, and thus source rate, of the subsequent C. cinctus population from B. inermis, 2) can C. cinctus larvae within B. inermis serve as critical second generation hosts for B. cephi and B. lissogaster, and 3) how do annual C. cinctus and parasitoid populations in B. inermis compare with those in adjacent cultivated wheat fields.",

We assessed the long and medium term temperature and precipitation trends of our field sites using weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Silver Spring, MA, USA). Data for each field site was averaged from three of the closest weather stations to that location. Data was plotted using R Studio (R Studio version 2024.04.0+735, R 2024) package ‘ggplot’ (version 3.4.4) (Wickham 2016). Data was then fit using a linear model using the ‘lm’ command using average yearly precipitation (inches) as the response variable and year as the predictor.\nNDVI analysis. We compared the relative greening throughout the growing season between wheat fields and adjacent B. inermis using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is typically used to assess vegetation health and density, and is calculated from the visible and near-infared light reflected by vegetation (Pettorelli et al. 2005). Data was downloaded using Google Earth Engine (Google Inc. 2023, Mountain View, CA, USA).\n\n\nControlled C. cinctus infestation of B. inermis\nInsects and Cages. Assessment of C. cinctus infestation and mortality within B. inermis were assessed using a 34 x 60 ft plot at the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. There is a negligible population of C. cinctus at this locaiton. The cage structure was built using 1-inch PVC piping with the netting made using 530\\(\\mu\\) Amber Lumite Screen (BioQuip\\(^\\circledR\\) Products, LLC). Twelve cages were built to dimensions of 6ft x 3ft x 3ft (L x W x H) with cage locations selected randomly based on the space available within the plot and arranged in sets of three.\nWheat stem stubble was collected in Three Forks, MT, USA (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W) from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation and cutting the year prior. Cut stubble, which contained C. cinctus larvae in diapause, were kept refrigerated between -2°C and 3°C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Once B. inermis stems reached six inches tall, stub containers with emerging sawflies were added to cages to mimic sawfly infestation pressure. Sawfly quantity treatments were as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).\nData Collection. In late August, B. inermis stems were collected from each cage. Each stem was sliced open using X-Acto® knives to collect data on infestation, dead larvae, live larvae, and parasitism at each internode.\n\n\nMontana Field Survey\nStem collection and processing. We conducted a field survey to assess C. cinctus infestation, larval mortality, and B. cephi and B. lissogaster prevalence within B. inermis and adjacent wheat fields. Sites were chosen across 2 counties in north-central Montana, United States. (Chouteau, Judith Basin), which consistently experience high C. cinctus pressure. Samples were collected from wheat fields and adjacent B. inermis in early July and late August in 2021, 2022, and 2023 from sites in Big Sandy, Moccasin, and Amsterdam, MT, USA. Sampling sites were set up as 100\\(m^2\\) polygons along the edge of adjoining wheat fields. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly selected within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected using a shovel to remove both stem and root material. Wheat stems were collected at distances of 5 and 20 meters from the edge of the field. Samples were collected in 4 rows at 10 meters apart. 2 samples were collected in each row at distances of 5 and 20 meters. 1 ft samples were collected at each point.\nWheat and B. inermis stems were then returned to Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana and stored in a 10°C cold wet storage until dissection. Stems were dissected lengthwise with a fine-bladed scalpel to determine presence or absence of C. cinctus larvae infestation, live eggs, dead eggs, dead larvae, live larvae, parasitism, and cutting. Sawfly larvae were identified based on descriptions in Criddle (1915) and Wallace and McNeal (1996).\nStatistical Analysis. We used generalized linear mixed models with binomial errors (logit link) fit using bound optimization by quadratic approximation, with a maximum of 200,000 iterations, were run in the lme4 package in R (Bates et al. 2015) to examine the effects of location and year (fixed effects) on each of the three response variables: proportion of stems infested, proportion of stems cut, and proportion of stems parasitized by Bracon spp.\nTo better understand the density of Bracon spp. within the wheat and B. inermis sampling sites, we converted our units to the ratio of parasitoids to surviving hosts stem per unit area. Densities of stems are different when considering B. inermis and cultivated wheat or barley. Using this conversion, we attempted to better understand how the density of parasitoids (and WSS) is changed by looking at each kind of plant.",

    "text": "Results\n\nHistorical Weather Analysis & NDVI\nWe observed a significant linear relationship (r = 0.1, P = 0.033, estimate = -0.058) between average precipitation and year for both Big Sandy and Moccasin, Montana. For each one-year increase, we are seeing a decrease in 0.05 inches of precipitation. (Fig. 1). Additionally, we observed a significant positive linear relationship (r = 0.245, P &lt; 0.05, estimate = 0.028) between year and average yearly temperature for Moccasin and Big Sandy, MT. Thus, each year, the average daily temperature has increased by 0.03°C. (Fig. 2).\nWe observed a notable difference in NDVI when comparing adjacent B. inermis and spring wheat. We saw a significant difference in the July NDVI (0.846, P &lt; 0.05). The B. inermis NDVI remained relatively linear in it’s downslope (BROME SLOPE POST JULY) compared to the wheat field (WHEAT FIELD POST JULY). (Fig. 3)\nNeed to add map showing where NDVI measurements came from\n\n\nControlled C. cinctus Infestation of B. inermis\nInitially, C. cinctus heavily infested stems of B. inermis in the controlled test conditions. Averaged across both years, we observed 66.5% of stems infested for high treatments and 47.3% of stems for low treatments. We found strong evidence suggesting that there was a significant difference between infestation at high and low treatment levels when holding year constant (r = 0.83, P &lt; 0.05, Fig. 3).\nStem cutting by mature larvae, leading into winter, was observed at 5.7% for the high treatments and 3.9% for the low, showing strong evidence for a difference in cutting between high and low treatment groups (r = 0.592, P &lt; 0.05).\nC. cinctus infested stems often contained larvae burrowing through multiple nodes. In 2022, 64.3% of stems were observed to have at least 4 nodes burrowed through. In 2023, 61.7% of stems had at least 4 nodes infested Fig. 5\n\n\nMontana Field Sites\nWe quantified C. cinctus and Bracon spp. parasitoid presence in 6,148 wheat and grass stems across 10 research sites in 2022 and 2023. Initial infestation by C. cinctus within B. inermis varied between collection sites, with the greatest infestation taking place within our three Big Sandy, MT sampling sites (2023: 65.4%, 2022: 63.1%), while the lowest infestation observed was in Moccasin, MT (2023: 40.8%, 2022: 60.7%). Across all sites in Big Sandy and Moccasin, we observed an average infestation of 57.5% within B. inermis and 47.6% within the adjacent wheat. Cutting by C. cintus was observed at an average rate of 5.59% (se = 0.0164) in B. inermis and 47.1% (se = 0.0386) in the adjacent cultivated wheat (Fig. 7.\nTo generate a relative estimate of the number of available C. cinctus host larvae within B. inermis late in the growing season, we calculated the number of stems that contained at least four or more nodes with burrowing injury. In Big Sandy, 76.2% of collected stems in the fall exhibited at least 4 nodes of burrowing injury. In Moccasin, the corresponding figure was 66.5%.\nWe utilized the ratio of parasitized stems to cut stems to better understand the true impact of our B. inermis sink/source ecology. The largest ratio observed was in Big Sandy, MT in the fall of 2022, where we observed a ratio of 16 parasitoids to a single cut stem. Thus, for every square meter of B. inermis, we would observe 16 stems that produced a parasitoid for every 1 stem that was likely to produce an adult C. cinctus. All three other sample selections also showed positive ratios of parasitoids to cut stems Fig. 8.\nTo understand the seasonal trends of Bracon spp use of potential C. cinctus hosts within B. inermis, we collected stem samples twice each growing season. We collected one pre-harvest, in July, and a second time in September, after all adult Bracon spp would be dead. We observed a significant difference (df = 96, r = 0.304, p &lt; 0.05) between parasitoid presence in infested stems collected in Big Sandy and Moccasin, MT.\nI want to drive home that stems with 3 + nodes infested likely had larave that were alive late into the summer. Compare the number of nodes infested in the summer to stems that have 3+ infested in the fall.",

    "text": "Discussion\nAssessing the comparative abundance of C. cinctus and its associated parasitoids within B. inermis and adjacent cultivated cereal hosts is an important initial step in evaluating whether semi-natural environments within road-side or coulee areas serve as sink or source origins for both pests and beneficial natural adversaries infiltrating agricultural crops. As the climate of central and northern Montana continues to change, wheat stem sawfly infestation will continue to impact cereal crop yields. In this study, we monitored how B. inermis may be potentially beneficial in ecologically buffering Bracon spp parasitoids by observing C. cinctus mortality within B. inermis and within adjacent cereal crops as well as Bracon spp prevalence.\n\nControlled Infestation\nResults from the controlled B. inermis infestation confirmed high C. cinctus larval morality prior to overwintering (Shanower and Hoelmer 2004, Buteler et al. 2008) with 53% of stems exhibiting C. cinctus burrowing damage. Of those infested stems, a large proportion exhibited larval damage in at least 4 nodes (62.5%). While stem collection and dissection did not align with the establishment of a timeline of living larvae (stems dissected in October), we can assert that stems with at least 4 nodes of infestation would have a high probability of being alive, and thus a viable potential parasitoid host, in late July and August of the same year.\nWhile total and per node B inermis infestation by C. cinctus was high, survival to overwintering (cutting) only occurred in 5.7% of C. cinctus infested stems. Our results indicate that B. inermis serves as a high-quality host for C. cinctus larvae during the spring and summer months. However, there was minimal survival of C. cinctus larvae in August and September, suggesting that there will be little adult emergence from B. inermis the following season.\n\n\nMontana Field Site Survey\nAnalysis of weather trends in Big Sandy and Moccasin, MT confirmed that the patterns in central and northern Montana are changing towards warmer and drier conditions (Pederson et al. 2009). We observed an average decrease in 0.058 inches of precipitation per year since 1975, while since 1950, temperatures have experienced an average yearly increase of 0.028°C. These changes in precipitation and temperature can have significant impacts on timing of crop production and harvest timing (Zhu and Burney 2021). Year-over-year populations of the Bracon spp parasitoids are particularly sensitive, as their bivoltine nature requires the second yearly generation to find a suitable C. cinctus host (Nelson and Farstad 1953, Runyon et al. 2002). NDVI analyses exhibited the prolonged senescence period for B. inermis when compared to adjacent cultivated wheat. C. cinctus larvae are cued via the thinning of the cell membranes during plant senescence to travel to the base of the stem and prepare for obligatory diapause (Beres et al. 2011). Because B. inermis senescence occurs at slower rates compared to wheat or barley, C. cinctus may remain within the stem later in into the summer and fall, providing potential host larvae for second generation Bracon parasitoids.\nPrevious research has shown B. inermis to be a quality host of both C. cinctus and Bracon spp parasitoids, but little data is available on the season fluctuation of B. inermis utilization (Criddle 1922, Peirce et al. 2021, Rand et al. 2024). Because we collected stem samples twice during the growing season, we were able to compare parasitoid activity. We hoped to understand how parasitism rates changed from July (pre-harvest) and September of each year.\nOur results showed that parasitoid presence increase significantly at all sites between pre- and post-harvest collections. Given the collection methods, September collection parasitism was inherently a combination of both pre-harvest and post-harvest activity. While we cannot ascertain Bracon preference for host stems, we can assess that the parasitoids utilize infested B. inermis stems post-harvest when C. cinctus is no longer available within wheat stems.\nAdditionally, we observed a high number of stems exhibiting levels of C. cinctus damage that point to prolonged larval presence within B. inermis stems. In Big Sandy (76.2%) and Moccasin (66.5%), stems that exhibited four or more nodes of burrowing damage correlates similarly to the assertion that C. cinctus larvae are available within B. inermis stems past wheat harvest. Most importantly, in years of drought or increased temperatures where wheat senescence and harvest may occur earlier in the summer.\nWe utilized parasitism to cut stem ratios to understand the relative impact of B. inermis host sources on overall field parasitism. Assessing overall numbers of insects can potentially diminish the apparent importance of B. inermis, as per square meter stem counts in cultivated wheat are denser than B. inermis counts within coulees and along roadsides B. inermis. Our findings of significantly greater ratios of parasitized stems to cut stems within B. inermis when compared to adjacent when indicates these field-side areas provide greater parasitoid source per square meter when compared to cultivated fields. This emphasizes the significance of accounting for habitat diversity to sustain parasitoid populations over successive years, as well as recognizing the crucial role of edge-row areas in maximizing parasitoid effectiveness in minimizing C. cinctus damage.\nOverall, this work suggests that maintaining and supporting field-edge areas containing B. inermis provides an unmistakable benefit to C. cinctus control in cereal crop production. The characteristics of B. inermis make it uniquely beneficial in both as a sink for C. cinctus larvae, and as a source for Bracon adults. B. inermis is a common grass found throughout the golden triangle of Montana and other wheat cultivation areas (Salesman and Thomsen 2011).",

    "text": "Introduction\nEcologists and farmers frequently hold divergent views regarding the importance of natural habitats within agricultural landscapes, a distinction often overlooked in ecological and conservation discourse (Tscharntke2016?). While ecologists recognize the role of natural habitats in supporting biodiversity and providing potential ecosystem services like biological pest control, many farmers perceive these habitat remnants as occupying valuable cropland or even as sources of pests. As such, documenting how pest and natural enemy populations interact with agricultural landscapes alongside natural habitat buffers is important in determining the degree of the services or disservices provided.\nNumerous polyphagous insect herbivores and their natural enemies rely on a variety of resources found across diverse habitat types within their environment. Depending upon the quality of the resource, different habitat types can serve as sources for increased pest or natural enemy populations. Similarly, habitat types can serve as sinks for decreased populations (Kennedy2000?). Altering the presence of these resources can have impacts on pest or natural enemy populations and can alter the ecology between the examined species. For example, diversifying the edge cropping of organic Kale (Brassica oleracea) using fava beans, fennel, and marigolds results in a diversity in beneficial arthropod communities that help reduce phytophagous herbivory (DeMorias2023?).\nUnderstanding the ways in which landscape habitat diversity impacts the ecological relationship between pest and enemy is crucial for effectively managing pest species in large scale cropping systems. Similarly, understanding how herbivore plant-hosts act as reservoirs for pests or beneficial natural enemies can potentially play a role in stabilizing year-over-year agricultural impact from these pests (Gordon1944?, Cano2022?).\nThe wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Hymenoptera Cephus cinctus Norton, is a grass-mining sawfly native to North America (Lesieur et al. 2016). Originally adept at utilizing wild grass hosts, the species became a major pest to cultivated cereals as the practice became more prevalent following European settlement, becoming a notable pest of winter wheat in 1990 (Criddle1993?). Adult female WSS use their saw-like ovipositor to lay their eggs in the lumen of stems, where the eggs hatch, leading to larval feeding of parenchyma tissue (Holmes1954?). Economic damage manifests in the form of both kernel weight reduction caused by tissue damage (Beres et al. 2011) and stem toppling due to late-season larval girdling (Holmes and Peterson 1960).\nSeveral parsitoid species attack C. cinctus within wild grass hosts (Davis et al. 1955, Morrill et al. 1998), however, two species, Bracon cephis (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), have been observed targeting WSS within cultivated cereals (Nelson and Farstad 1953, Morrill?). These two host-specific ectoparasitoids are native to North America. Both parasitoids are bivoltine, with the first generation present in Montana from late June to late July, while the second generation is active in August and September (Somsen and Luginbill 1956). Adult female B. cephi and B. lissogaster paralyze C. cinctus larvae within the host stem, paralyze the host larvae, and depositing 1 (B. cephi) to three (B. lissogaster) eggs. B. cephi and B. lissogaster have been shown to provide biological control via irreplaceable mortality of C. cinctus populations (Buteler et al. 2015) and can significantly reduce C. cinctus damage and impact on crop yields (Buteler et al. 2008, Rand et al. 2020). While C. cinctus has a wide range of viable host plants, including native and non-native grasses and cultivated row-crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare)(Wallace and McNeal 1966, Cockrell et al. 2017), infestation levels can vary widely across hosts. Previous research has shown preference for host plants with larger stem diameter (Ainslie 1920, Bhandari 2020).\nPrevious research has shown natural non-cultivated grasses such as Agropyron cristatum, B. inermis, Elymus trachycaulus, and Elytrigia intermedium host C. cinctus and Bracon spp. parasitoids quite well (Peirce2022?, Rand2024?). We find investigating B. inermis holds the most potential, as it has been shown to be a quality host for C. cinctus while also leading to high larval mortality (Farstad and Jacobson 1945). However, there is a lack of refined data relating to the total infestation, cutting, and parasitization within B. inermis at multiple time points throughout the growing season. Quantificative assessment of potential ‘reservoire’ characteristics and local spatial information could prove useful in fully understanding the ecological impacts of maintaining B. inermis along roadways and within coulles.\nSmooth brome (Bromus inermis Lyess) is a Eurasian cool-season rhizomatous grass introduced to the United States in 1884 (Salesman and Jessica 2011).B. inermis was originally thought of as potentially useful as a trap crop in order to combat the growing WSS problem with cultural control practices (Farstad and Jacobson 1945). Due to its low agricultural value, and propensity to form monocultures and out compete many native grasses, B. inermis is categorized as invasive (Carlson and Newell 1985, Willson and Stubbendieck 2000, Dillemuth et al. 2008). However, B. inermis still holds immense ecological value in its late senescence and WSS antibiosis properties (Otfinowski et al. 2006, Rand2024?).\nMontana’s golden triangle, an area of central and northern Montana with intense cereal grain production, is prone to drought and burning via wildfire (Wilson1923?). As both C. cinctus and its host-specific parasitoids are relatively restricted in their annual mobility (Weaver et al. 2005), environmental extremes can have broad impacts on both local pest and natural enemy populations. As with many predator-prey interactions, the C. cinctus and parasitoid populations fluctuate, with crashes and spikes experienced in close succession. Similar examples can be found in wolves and moose on Isle Royale (Peterson1999?), and Coccinelidae and aphids (Evans1991?).\nWe examined historical weather data from our field sites in central and northern Montana. We used this data to understand how changes in global climate trends may be impacting B. cephis and B. inermis populations. In addition we analyzed normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) at our field sites to understand how B. inermis senescence patterns compare to adjacent cultivated wheat.\nIn this study, we explored the ecological patterns between Montana populations of C. cinctus and its braconid parsitoids in relation to B. inermis host sites. Our goal, was 1) to understand the degree to which C. cinctus infested B. inermis stems in relation to neighboring cereal crops, and 2) the way in which braconid parasitoids utilized WSS hosts within B. inermis stems. To do so, we conducted two separate studies. In our first study, we conducted controlled C. cinctus infestation of B. inermis to understand the relative infestation and cutting rate of C. cinctus within the B. inermis stems. The second study examined rates of cutting and parasitism at field sites in central and northern Montana.\nUsing these studies, we addressed three questions, 1) what is the total cutting, and thus source rate, of C. cinctus from B. inermis, 2) can C. cinctus larvae within B. inermis serve as second generation hosts for B. cephi and B. lissogaster, and 3) how do C. cinctus and parasitoid populations in B. inermis compare with those in adjacent cultivated wheat fields."

    "text": "Materials and Methods\n\nWeather data and NDVI analysis\nWeather data. We assessed the long and medium term temperature and precipitation trends of our field sites using weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Silver Spring, MA, USA). Data for each field site was averaged from three of the closest weather stations to that location. Data was plotted using R Studio (R Studio version 2024.04.0+735, R 2024) package ‘ggplot’ (version 3.4.4) (Wickham 2016). Data was then fit using a linear model using the ‘lm’ command using average yearly precipitation (inches) as the response variable and year as the predictor.\nNDVI analysis. We compared the relative greening throughout the growing season between wheat fields and adjacent B. inermis using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is typically used to assess vegetation health and density, and is calculated from the visible and near-infared light reflected by vegetation (Pettorelli et al. 2005). Data was downloaded using Google Earth Engine (Google Inc. 2023, Mountain View, CA, USA).\n\n\nControlled C. cinctus infestation of B. inermis\nInsects and Cages. Assessment of C. cinctus infestation and mortality within B. inermis were assessed using a 34 x 60 ft plot at the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. The cage structure was built using 1-inch PVC piping with the netting made using 530\\(\\mu\\) Amber Lumite Screen (BioQuip\\(^\\circledR\\) Products, LLC). Twelve cages were built to dimensions of 6ft x 3ft x 3ft (L x W x H) with cage locations selected randomly based on the space available within the plot and arranged in sets of three.\nWheat stem stubble was collected in Three Forks, MT, USA (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W) from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation and cutting the year prior. Cut stubble, which contained C. cinctus larvae in diapause, were kept refrigerated between -2°C and 3°C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Once B. inermis stems reached six inches tall, stub containers with emerging sawflies were added to cages to mimic sawfly infestation pressure. Sawfly quantity treatments were as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).\nData Collection. In late August, B. inermis stems were collected from each cage. Each stem was sliced open using X-Acto® knives to collect data on infestation, dead larvae, live larvae, and parasitism at each internode.\n\n\nMontana Field Survey\nStem collection and processing. We conducted a field survey to assess C. cinctus infestation, larval mortality, and B. cephi and B. lissogaster prevalence within B. inermis and adjacent wheat fields. Sites were chosen across 2 counties in north-central Montana, United States. (Chouteau, Judith Basin), which consistently experience high C. cinctus pressure. Samples were collected from wheat fields and adjacent B. inermis in early July and late August in 2021, 2022, and 2023 from sites in Big Sandy, Moccasin, and Amsterdam, MT, USA. Sampling sites were set up as 100\\(m^2\\) polygons along the edge of adjoining wheat fields. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly selected within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected using a shovel to remove both stem and root material. Wheat stems were collected at distances of 5 and 20 meters from the edge of the field. Samples were collected in 4 rows at 10 meters apart. 2 samples were collected in each row at distances of 5 and 20 meters. 1 ft samples were collected at each point.\nWheat and B. inermis stems were then returned to Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana and stored in a 10°C cold wet storage until dissection. Stems were dissected lengthwise with a fine-bladed scalpel to determine presence or absence of C. cinctus larvae infestation, live eggs, dead eggs, dead larvae, live larvae, parasitism, and cutting. Sawfly larvae were identified based on descriptions in Criddle (1915) and Wallace and McNeal (1996).\nStatistical Analysis. We used generalized linear mixed models with binomial errors (logit link) fit using bound optimization by quadratic approximation, with a maximum of 200,000 iterations, were run in the lme4 package in R (Douglas Bates et al. 2015) to examine the effects of location and year (fixed effects) on each of the three response variables: proportion of stems infested, proportion of stems cut, and proportion os stems parasitized by Bracon spp. ’\nTo better understand the density of Bracon spp. within the wheat and B. inermis sampling sites, we converted our units to the ratio of parasitoids to stem per unit area. Densities of stems are different when considering B. inermis and cultivated wheat or barley. Using this conversion, we attempted to better understand how the density of parasitoids (and WSS) is changed by looking at each kind of plant."

This means that for each one year increase, we are seeing a decrease in 0.05 inches of precipitation. (Fig. 1). Additionally, we observed a significant positive linear relationship (r = 0.245, P &lt; 0.05, estimate = 0.028) between year and average yearly temperature for Moccasin and Big Sandy, MT. This means that each year, the average daily temperature has increased by 0.03°C. (Fig. 2).\nWe observed a notable difference in NDVI when comparing adjacent B. inermis and spring wheat. We saw a significant difference in the July NDVI (0.846, P &lt; 0.05). The B. inermis NDVI remained relatively linear in it’s downslope (BROME SLOPE POST JULY) compared to the wheat field (WHEAT FIELD POST JULY). (Fig. 3)\nNeed to add map showing where NDVI measurments came from\n\n\nControlled C. cinctus Infestation of B. inermis\nC. cinctus showed high infestation of B. inermis in the controlled test conditions. Averaged across both years, we observed 66.5% of stems infested for high treatments and 47.3% of stems for low treatments. We found strong evidence suggesting that there was a significant difference between infestation at high and low treatment levels when holding year constant (r = 0.83, P &lt; 0.05, Fig. 3).\nCutting was observed at 5.7% for the high treatments and 3.9% for the low, showing strong evidence for a difference in cutting between high and low treatment groups (r = 0.592, P &lt; 0.05).\nC. cinctus infested stems often contained larvae burrowing through multiple nodes. In 2022, 64.3% of stems were observed to have at least 4 nodes burrowed through. In 2023, 61.7% of stems had at least 4 nodes infested Fig. 5\n\n\nMontana Field Sites\nWe quantified C. cinctus and Bracon spp. parasitoid presence in 6,148 wheat and grass stems across 10 research sites in 2022 and 2023. Infestation by C. cinctus within B. inermis varied between collection sites, with the greatest infestation taking place within our three Big Sandy, MT sampling sites (2023: 65.4%, 2022: 63.1%), while the lowest infestation observed was in Moccasin, MT (2023: 40.8%, 2022: 60.7%). Across all sites in Big Sandy and Moccasin, we observed an average infestation of 57.5% within B. inermis and 47.6% within the adjacent wheat. Cutting by C. cintus was observed at an average rate of 5.59% (se = 0.0164) in B. inermis and 47.1% (se = 0.0386) in the adjacent cultivated wheat (fig. 7.\nTo generate a relative estimate of the number of available C. cinctus host larvae within B. inermis late in the growing season, we calculated the number of stems that contained at least four or more nodes of infestation. In Big Sandy, 76.2% of collected stems in the fall exhibited at least 4 nodes of infestation. In Moccasin, the corresponding figure was 66.5%.\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n# Groups:   collection, year, region [4]\n  collection year  region    brome wheat\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 fall       2022  big sandy  5    0.310\n2 fall       2022  moccasin   1.36 0.105\n3 fall       2023  big sandy  2.33 0.591\n4 fall       2023  moccasin   1.27 0.115\n\n\n[1] 155\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n[1] 16.12903\n\n\nWe utilized the ratio of parasitized stems to cut stems to better understand the true impact of our B. inermis sink/source ecology. The largest ratio observed was in Big Sandy, MT in the fall of 2022, where we observed a ratio of 16 parasitoids to 1 cut stem. This means that for every 1 square meter of B. inermis, we would observe 16 stems that produced a parasitoid for every 1 stem that produced an adult C. cinctus. All three other sample selections also showed positive ratios of parasitoids to cut stems fig. 8.\nI want to drive home that stems with 3 + nodes infested likely had larave that were alive late into the summer. Compare the number of nodes infested in the summer to stems that have 3+ infested in the fall."

The cages were removed from the plot after 3 weeks of sawfly release.\n\n\nInsects\nWheat stem stubble was collected in Three Forks, MT, USA (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W) from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation and cutting in the prior year. Cut stubble, which contained C. cinctus larvae in diapause, were kept refrigerated between -2°C and 3°C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Stubs were added to cages once B. inermis stems reached six inches tall, with sawfly quantity treatments as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).\n\nData Collection\nStems were collected from each cage site in late August. All stems from each 6 x 3 ft cage section were collected. Each stem was sliced open using X-Acto® knives to collect data on infestation, dead larvae, live larvae, and parasitism at each internode.",

As a general thought exercise, the more nodes a larvae burrowed through, the larger the larvae.

Volatile compounds were collected from healthy (size/stage) locoweed plants. Plants were paired based on size similarity, with one being E+ and the other E-. Three sets of pairs (twelve plants) were used for each volatile collection event. Collection was undergone for a period of six hours from 09:00 to 15:00.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Image Gallery\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nGreenhouse Locoweed volatiles were collected from plants that looked like these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolatiles were collected from twleve plants per day using glass volatile collection chambers (VCCs) that were 30 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. The top end of each VCC funneled into a threaded port that was 10 cm in daimter. Threaded onto the top of each VCC was an eight-port “octopus” manifold adapter. Two glass filter traps (6.35 mm diameter x 76 mm length; Analytical Research Systems, Gainesville, FL) with 30 mg of Super-Q absorbent (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) were inserted into two of the adapter ports. The remaining six collection ports were sealed to prevent ambient air exchange and pressure loss. One of the traps was used to collected extraneous volatiles from the initial experiment set up for the first ten minutes, whereas the other trap was used to collect volatile compounds emanating from plants beginning ten minutes after the system was turned on. An air source was connected to the base of each collection chamber with supply from charcoal air filters. A vacuum pump was used to maintain air pressure and flow rate (humidified air at 1.0 liter/min) within the collection system. A small piece of cotton encompassed by a Teflon® guillotine was used at the base of each plant to tightly seal the base of the system and prevent external air from entering. Laboratory tape was used to seal the edges of the guillotine and prevent contamination by ambient and soil derived volatiles.\nVolatile collection and successive GC-MS analysis were conducted following methods described in Weaver et al. (2009). After the six hour collection period, glass volatile collection traps were eluted using 200 µL of dichloromethane into 2 mL screw top vials (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), followed by a slow release of nitrogen to further clear the volatile trap. 10 µL of nonyl acetate solution was added to the eluted solution as internal standard to quantify compounds. Samples were then subject to gas chromatography (GC) on a J&W HP – 5ms; 30m x 0.25 µm film thickness column (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The GC unit (Agilent 6890; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was paired with a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent 5973 instrument).

Since our data clearly violates this assumption, we have decided against using this method.",

Let’s look at comparing PCA results if we change our response variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like from our plant type PCA that there is a difference in the variance of the volatile profile emitted by flowers compared to leaves. Let’s break up our samples and run a separate PCA for flowers and for leaves and see if we notice a bigger difference between our E+ and E- groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven after splitting up our samples into flower and leaf subgroups, visually there does not appear to be a significant difference in volatile profiles between E+ and E-.",

The tail on the right half of the plot dramatically skews away from the normality line.\nIn addition, the results from the Anderson-Darling normality tests (table 1) reveal that every variable in individually non-normal.\nAs we can see, our data violates the normality assumption. This is the case even though we ran it though a CLR transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA quick note here.\nMany papers analyzing ecological or compositional data and VOC datasets often employ a statistical test known as MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance). Despite the similarity of the data to ours in many instances, MANOVA is used even though the data being analyzed violates the normality assumption. Since our data clearly violates this assumption, we have decided against using this method.",

Samples were collected in both early July and late August in 2021, 2022, and 2023 from sites in Big Sandy, Moccasin, and Amsterdam, MT, USA. Sample locations were chosen by identifying fields with consistent wheat production that were adjacent to healthy B. inermis stands, either situated between fields or between fields and roadways. Polygons containing B. inermis were set up along the periphery of adjacent wheat fields, each covering an area of approximately 100 meters. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly selected within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected. The stems were then processed and split in the laboratory to assess infestation, live eggs, dead eggs, dead larvae, live larvae, parasitism, and cutting.",

This was likely due a cold, mild spring that led to late stem development. Because the wheat was not well developed, the sawflies did not infest. This appears to have led to high infestation within the smooth brome. Will be interesting to compare to 2022 when stem elongation followed normal expected timelines.\n\n\nLochy Property - Gardiner Road\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Centered Image Expand\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Gardiner road underwent a major reconstruction with both ditches being regraded.

The data was first transformed using a center log-ratio (CLR) transformation, a technique commonly used when analyzing multivariate compositional data (Brückner and Heethoff 2017). VOC compositions were compared between samples and types using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, Canberra distance, 999 iterations) tests implemented in the vegan package (v 2.6-4) (Oksanen et al. 2011). This technique uses permutation testing to generate many different rearrangements of the data to assess if the observed differences are statistically significant (Anderson 2017). Data were visualized using ggplot2 (Wickham 2016).

There’s a crucial distinction to be made here. In one set of plots, I’ll filter out the specified category after running the PCA on the entire data set. This will result in plots with ellipses and points identical to those seen in the plots of the entire data set, just with the non-specified data removed. Additionally, I’ll show plots that display PCA results from data filtered prior to running the PCA model. In these plots, points and ellipses have the potential to appear different from the previous display method.\nI’ve also created plots showing just the ellipses for the specified groups, while leaving the rest of the data set grey. It should hopefully all become clearer as we proceed through each section.\nIn my opinion, using a PCA plot to represent a data set and then filtering the data after running the PCA model might not accurately depict the relationship between the variables. The placement of points on a PCA plot is influenced by the entire data set, so removing some data afterward could distort the representation and make it less meaningful.\nAs a reference, I’m going to show the plot from all varaibles and data on the right side.\nLet’s start by removing the natural hybrids from our PCA and view the results.\n\nCompare: DT, YT, Synthetic\n\nPost-PCA Model Filter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload File Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Download\n  \n  \n\n  \n    Download\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-PCA Model Filter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload File Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Download\n  \n  \n\n  \n    Download\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare: Synthetic and Natural\n\nPost-PCA Model Filter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload File Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Download\n  \n\n\n  \n    Download\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve also plotted just the two hybrid plant categories but included the data points from the rest of the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload File Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Download\n  \n  \n\n  \n    Download\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-PCA Model Filter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload File Buttons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Download\n  \n\n\n  \n    Download\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running all of these plots, it looks to me like the largest differences are between the PRE and Post PCA Model plots when we removed the Natural category.

Native to North America (Lesieur et al. 2016), the largest populations of WSS are currently found in the western Canadian prairies as well as Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, and North and South Dakota (Wallace and McNeal 1966; Weiss and Morrill 1992; Cockrell et al. 2021)."

    "text": "Host Plants of Wheat Stem Sawfly\nWheat stem sawfly was first found the hollow-stemmed wild grasses such as Agropyron and Elymus in Colorado in 1872 (Ainslie, 1920). Soon thereafter it was found in wheat in 1895 in Manitoba, Canada. First referred to as the “western-grass stem sawfly”, WSS was found with native Montana grasses including western wheatgrass (Pascopyrun smithii) and slender wheat grass (Elymus trachycaulus) (Ainslie, 1920). As settlers began moving west and small grain cereal crop production increased on the landscape, the native grasses that WSS foraged upon became quite rare (Ainslie, 1929). WSS was found damaging spring wheat for the first time in 1895 in Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Wallace and McNeal, 1966). With the diminishment of its natural hosts, WSS has adapted to infest the exotic non-cultivated and cultivated grasses now present (Criddle, 1923). WSS infestation has been shown in many species native to Montana including western wheatgrass (Pascopyrun smithii), slender wheat grass (Elymus trachycaulus) and bluebunch wheatgrass, Pseudoroegneria spicata (Cockrell et al., 2021).\nSmooth brome (Bromus inermis L.) is a Eurasian cool-season rhizomatous grass introduced to the United States in 1884 from Hungary and Russia for soil conservation and use as livestock feed (Salesman and Jessica, 2011). Throughout the early 19th and 20th century, it was used throughout much of the upper half of North America. It is a perennial grass, and more drought resistant than other exotic grasses (Mapfumo et al., 2002). Due to its sod forming nature and large root system, it is extensively used to promote soil retention along highways (USDA-NRCS 2010).\nSmooth brome was originally thought of as potentially useful as a trap crop in order to combat the growing WSS problem with cultural control practices (Farstad and Jacobson, 1945). However, due to its propensity to form monocultures and outcompete many native grasses, smooth brome was labeled by many as invasive (Carlson and Newell, 1985; Willson and Stubbendieck, 2000; Dillemuth et al., 2008). Smooth brome populations play a considerable role in altering native herbivore population dynamics and movement on the prairies of North America (Dillemuth et al., 2008)."

    "section": "Biology of Wheat Stem Sawfly",
    "text": "Biology of Wheat Stem Sawfly\n\nAdult\nAdults are relatively small (8-13 mm) with a narrow elongated and slightly compressed black body, yellow legs, and three characteristic black bands across the abdomen. Females are larger than males and a visible long, dark, ovipositor. Both male and female adults are weak fliers, rarely flying long distances at one time (Criddle, 1923). They can be found on stems with their heads downward and legs aligned with their body, encircling the stem (Ainslie, 1920; Criddle, 1923). WSS are univoltine, having only one generation per year. Males are haploid (9 chromosomes), while females are diploid – females who do not find a mate will produce male offspring, while those who do produce female progeny (Holmes, 1978). Fully mature adults hatch in the spring once it has sufficiently warmed and the moisture levels in the soil reach threshold levels (Holmes, 1978; Perez-Mendoza and Weaver, 2006). In Montana, this period begins in mid- to late-May and ends early in July (Morrill and Kushnak, 1996; Weaver et al., 2005). Their lifespan usually lasts around five to eight days, emerging from May until June. Males emerge before the females, ensuring that many of the early females to hatch will find a mate and deposit eggs that will be female (Mackay, 2011). Copulation lasts less than one minute with the male holding the back of the female with their abdomen curved down under the female ovipositor. Fertilized females lay eggs several hours after copulation (Holmes, 1978).\n\n\nOviposition\nAfter locating a suitable host stem, female WSS oviposit an egg inside the host plant lumen. WSS larvae hatch inside the stem and feed on the stem’s parenchyma tissue (Beres et al., 2011). As the stem begins to senesce in the fall, the larvae travel to the base of the stem and makes a V-shaped groove (Criddle, 1923) above a constructed protective hibernaculum where they will overwinter (Holmes and Peterson, 1960). As a result of this deep groove, the stem weakens and topples easily. The resulting lodged stems are not only challenging for growers to harvest but also exhibit decreased kernel yield (Beres et al., 2011).\n\n\nEgg\nNewly laid eggs are crescent in shape, milky-white in color, and range between 1 mm to 1.25 mm in length and 0.33 to 0.42 mm wide (Ainslie, 1920). After oviposition, the egg lies freely within the lumen of the host stem or in a hollow created by the female WSS ovipositor (Fulbright et al., 2017). Laval development occurs rapidly with the recognizable shape becoming apparent at day three. By day five, the jaws turn brown as the eye spots begin to appear and darken. By day six or seven, the larva begins to hatch using a series of convulsive movements and emerges into the stem cavity, with full functionality achieved by the seventh day (Ainslie, 1920).\n\n\nLarvae\nAfter hatching and prior to feeding, the larvae are transparent and colorless (Ainslie, 1920; Criddle, 1923). WSS larvae are distinguishable from other larvae feeding in wheat and grasses by their highly sclerotized head capsule and large body size (Nelson and Farstad, 1953). As the larvae chew their way through the parenchymous and vascular tissues of the host stem, the larvae begin to develop a yellow-green color. As the larvae progress through the stem, they excrete frass; the digested plant tissue as well as metabolic breakdown products from the WSS (Beres et al., 2011). If multiple eggs are laid within the same stem, the largest (usually the first egg laid and hatched) will typically remain within a few weeks due to the larvae cannibalizing one another (Criddle, 1923; Seamans et al., 1944; Buteler et al., 2015). It remains unknown whether the consumption of other eggs and larvae is the result of intentional cannibalism or the indirect result of indiscriminate feeding (Buteler et al., 2015). As the host plant physiologically matures, and the larvae reaches its fifth instar, the insect is cued to travel to the base of stem and prepare for obligatory diapause (Beres et al., 2011). The descending movement of larvae and development of the hibernaculum are triggered by the host plant senescence. As the stem walls becoming increasingly transparent, they allow increased amounts of visible and infrared light into the stem (Holmes, 1977; Beres et al., 2011). Once the larvae reach the base of the stem, they construct an interior V-shaped groove, making the stem weak enough to lodge due to gravity or wind (Criddle, 1923). The larvae then plug the remaining stub with frass to insulate the hibernaculum during diapause (Holmes and Peterson, 1960). The larval stage of development can be as short as 30 days before entering diapause. Obligatory diapause lasts a minimum of 90 days (Salt and Hollick, 1947). After the larvae are exposed to temperatures less than 10C for 90 days, diapause is complete, and pupation can begin. Larvae can reenter diapause if temperatures approach 35C (Salt and Hollick, 1947) or if conditions are abnormally dry (Holmes, 1978) shortly after termination of diapause.\n\n\nPupae\nOnce diapause is complete, pupal development begins. Pupation lasts for 21 days, beginning in early- to mid-May (Criddle, 1923). Initially, the pupa is milky-white in color (Ainslie, 1920), gradually changing to bright white as the wings develop (Fulbright et al., 2017). Additionally, as development continues, characteristic brown and black eye spots appear on the surface of the pupae. Once pupation is complete, the adult sawfly will chew through either the frass plug or the side of the stub, and emerge ready for flight (Ainslie, 1920; Holmes and Peterson, 1960)."

    "section": "Damage Caused by Wheat Stem Sawfly",
    "text": "Damage Caused by Wheat Stem Sawfly\nWheat stem sawfly larvae travel throughout the stem of the host plant, feeding on the parenchymal tissue and chewing through the nodes. As a result, vascular translocation of water and nutrients within the plant is impaired (Macedo et al., 2007) and causes a notable reduction yield and quality of the grain produced (Seamans et al., 1944; Holmes, 1977; Morrill et al., 1992). In addition, the weakening of the stem due to WSS causes lodging prior to harvest, exacerbated by larvae stem girdling. Stem lodging causes a reduction in stem harvest efficiently (Ainslie, 1920), with yield lost due to unrecoverable lodged stem (Beres et al., 2007). Additionally, the reduction in stubble residues decreases snow retention which increases soil erosion and reduces soil moisture content (Keren et al., 2015)."

    "text": "Management of Wheat Stem Sawfly\n\nChemical Control\nBecause WSS are stem mining pests and spend most of their lives within the host plant stem, the use of traditional pest control methods such as insecticides have proven to be ineffective. The only life stage of WSS that takes place outside of the stem, the adult, is not targetable via chemical treatment due to adult emergence and oviposition taking place over many weeks (Knodel et al., 2010; Beres et al., 2011). WSS infestation chemical control methods were first tested as early as 1949 (Wallace, 1962). After using six different organochlorine and organophosphate insecticidal dust applied via a powder duster (Munro et al., 1949) the authors found “unsatisfactory results that did not control” WSS populations or limit infestations. In 1963, it was reported that a 73% control of WSS infestation could be achieved via granular heptachlor applied in the furrow with the wheat seed (Wallace, 1962). However, the findings of these tests were not able to be replicable in all scenarios of WSS infestation (Holmes et al., 1963). Heptachlor required light sawfly infestation – restricted to the lower internodes – to be effective. When infestation rates were high, and oviposition occurred in the upper internodes, the researchers saw little to no control. Similar results were found when testing with foliar insecticides, findings showing little differences in their effect when compared to controls (Blodgett et al., 1996). While the Montana Department of Agriculture has authorized the use of systemic organophosphate insecticide phorate (Thimet®) for use controlling WSS infestation in winter and spring wheat cultivars, it’s use is not considered environmentally friendly due to high toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish. Additionally, a preharvest interval of 85 days complicates harvest scheduling (Ginsberg, 2003; Mahajan et al., 2006), while the high toxicity may have potential adverse effects on beneficial parasitoid populations (Varella, 2016).\n\n\nCultural Control\n\nHost Plant Resistance\nMechanisms like antixenosis, antibiosis, and tolerance give a plant the ability to resist insect pests (Horber, 1980; Wilson et al., 1987). Antixenosis allows the host plant to trigger resistance by inducing non-preference in herbivores when they attempt to feed or oviposit. Recent work done by Achhami et al. (2020) found that Barely cultivars that closely resemble wheat show the greatest frequency of WSS oviposition. These findings suggest that semiochemicals produced by these barley cultivars, such as (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (Piesik et al., 2008; Buteler et al., 2009) and (Z)-β-ocimene (Buteler and Weaver, 2012), are likely similar to those produced by wheat (Achhami et al., 2020). Antibiosis causes the improper development of herbivores, impacting survivability and reproduction. Tolerance allows the host plant to withstand infestation and overcome injuries (Van Emden, 1991; Van Zoeren and Guedot, 2017). Much of the research done on WSS resistant wheat cultivars focuses on solid stem trait and pith expression (Platt and Farstad, 1949; Varella et al., 2016; Varella et al., 2017). Solid stem varieties are more resistant to infestation, reducing WSS oviposition and increasing egg mortality (Holmes and Peterson, 1960; Varella et al., 2016). The increased pith expression also disrupts larvae movement within the stem, leading to higher larval mortality due to reduced feeding as well as smaller and less reproductively successful adults (Wallace and McNeal, 1966). In addition, greater pith expression increases stem strength, reducing losses due to lodged stems (Delaney et al., 2010). Additional factors including late planting and shorter crop duration, have been suggested as potential factors complicating antixenosis, leading to increased WSS oviposition and infestation (Achhami et al., 2020). The solid-stemmed trait has been developed in numerous spring and some winter wheat cultivars (Beres et al., 2011). While the use of solid-stemmed cultivars is most often recommended for WSS management (Beres et al., 2011), hollow-stemmed cultivars were found to exhibit greater parasitism when compared to solid-stemmed varieties (Holmes et al., 1963). It was previously suggested by Rand et al. (2012) that the thicker pith found in solid-stemmed cultivars makes sensing WSS larvae vibrations (Mankin et al., 2004) more difficult for female parasitoids. The inability to locate WSS hosts would then cause ineffective parasitism.\n\n\nTillage\nTillage is a potential control method for the WSS. Larvae are protected against both water loss and freezing temperatures by the soil surrounding the wheat stubble where the WSS overwinters. Tilling the soil exposes the wheat stubble to the soil surface, conditions which kill the hibernating larvae (Callenback and Hansmeier, 1944). Tillage of the WSS has been shown to be effective in decreasing the pest’s populations in both spring and winter wheat cultivars. Upwards of 90% mortality has been shown in North Dakota after fall tillage (Weiss et al., 1987). Many factors influence the effectiveness of tilling, including adequate exposure of wheat stubs on the soil surface and appropriate timing (Holmes and Farstad, 1956; Morrill et al., 1992; Weiss and Morrill, 1992). While the variability in effectiveness exists, some growers do consider it a crucial management tool (Blodgett et al., 1996; Lesieur et al., 2016). While effective in killing WSS larvae, there are negative impacts caused by this practice. Water loss, soil compaction, and erosion have all been shown to be dramatically increased by tilling activities (Phillips et al., 1980; Lal, 1991). In addition, tilling practices negatively impact beneficial populations of parasitoid wasps that target the WSS. WSS parasitoids overwinter higher in the stem compared to at the base like WSS (Morrill et al., 1998; Runyon et al., 2002a). By displacing soil when tilling, the upper portion of the plant is buried under the soil, preventing the parasitoid wasps from emerging in the spring (Runyon et al., 2002a; Weaver et al., 2004).\n\n\nPlant Density and Spacing\nHistorically, it has been observed that wheat fields with wider row spacing (12 inches) have greater WSS cutting when compared to fields with reduced spacing (3 to 6 inches). Additionally, fields planted at greater seed density with solid stem cultivars exhibit lower WSS cutting compared to reduced seed density (Luginbill and McNeal, 1958). The reason for this relationship between decreased density and increased sawfly infestation is due to the moisture availability and height of the wheat stems. At higher densities, each stem has access to less water, in turn leading to the stem to develop a thicker pith – more solid stemmed. As discussed above, there is a negative linear relationship between an increase in the solid-stem characteristic and infestation (Kemp, 1934).\n\n\nCrop Rotation\nContinually planting wheat year after year creates ideal conditions for the WSS (Callenbach and Hansmeier, 1945). Rotating wheat with more resistant wheat varieties as well as with oats, or soybeans (crops that are less or not susceptible to WSS infestation) is recommended to decrease the year after year WSS infestation rates (Lin and Chen, 2014). The notable downside to utilizing crop rotation in a matter that is effective is the economic downside. Alternate-year, summer fallow production systems are typical for wheat growing practices across much of the northern great plains of the United States (Weiss and Morrill, 1992; Troeh et al., 1999).\n\n\nTrap Crops\nTrap cropping utilized non-economically important plantings to help reduce populations or block movement of pests into valuable crop areas (Hokkanen and Jokioinen, 1991). Effective trap crops of the WSS should have appealing characteristics to the WSS to attract the pest to the trap planting, and away from the wheat (Farstad, 1940). Historically, planted trap strips were used by attracting sawflies and destroying the strip at the end of the season, eliminating the larvae (Morrill et al., 1992). However, utilizing trap plantings of highly attractive wheat varieties has been shown to hold limited viability, as growers are not fond of destroying planted grain at the end of the growing season (Goosey, 1999). Alternative utilization of WSS traps entail planting and/or maintaining strips of smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) or other WSS host grasses (Farstad, 1940). Smooth brome in particular holds potential as it is a poor host to WSS larvae (Bhandari, 2020), yet WSS adults continue to oviposit the stems. This relationship of greater oviposition with increased mortality may lead to decreases in overall WSS populations.\n\n\nDelayed Planting & Swathing\nWheat planted later in the growing season avoids much of the damage caused by the WSS as the wheat reaches stem elongation after many of the adult sawflies have already laid their eggs (Jacobson and Farstad, 1952). The problem with delayed planting is that the practice is known to make less efficient use the earl season moisture in the soil (Morrill and Kushnak, 1996). Growers may need to weigh the tradeoffs in delayed planting to reduce losses in areas with a history of severe infestation. Swathing, also known as windrowing, is the practice of cutting the wheat to accelerate the drying process and decrease the losses caused by WSS cutting (Holmes and Peterson, 1965; Carlson, 2019; McCullough et al., 2020). By cutting the wheat and letting it dry prior to sawfly cutting, swathing works by reducing losses due to lodging (Ainslie, 1920).\n\n\nBiological Control Methods\nThe use of biocontrol in limiting WSS populations has been well studied with variable results. There are currently three types of organisms that have been reported as biocontrol agents of the WSS in wheat fields: Soil fungal pathogens, the predatory beetle Phyllobaenus dubius, and two parasitic Hymenoptera.\n\n\nSoil Fungal Pathogens\nFungal pathogens are found throughout both the plant and animal kingdoms. Several fungi have been shown to negatively impact WSS larvae infestation within wheat stems. While highly lethal to sawfly larvae, F. graminearum, F. acuminatum, F. equiseti, and F. avenaceum also cause crown rot in the host plant. The trade-off between WSS control and crown rot may limit Fusarium spp. usefulness to WSS management. (Wenda-Piesik et al., 2009). Findings by Tangtrakulwanich et al. (2014) found that the fungi B. bassiana and M. brunneum effectively reduced damage caused by WSS. Both fungi kill insects by infecting via spore contact or by insect consumption of treated plant tissue (Portman et al., 2018).\n\n\nPredatory Beetle\nPhyllobaenus dubius (Wolcott) has been observed emerging from wheat stubble and within dissected wheat stems in Montana (Morrill et al., 2001). Further research is required on this coleopteran to determine its prospects going forward as an effective WSS management tool.\n\n\nParasitoids of the Wheat Stem Sawfly\nTwo parasitoid wasps are known target the wheat stem sawfly in wheat fields. The congeneric parasitoids, Bracon cephi (Gahan) and B. lissogaster Muesebeck, are the most effective agents of WSS biological control (Runyon et al., 2001). B. cephi and B. lissogaster, as distinguished by Runyon et al. (2001), were initially limited in their ability to parasitize WSS larvae within wheat stems. The wheat stem sawfly, originally known as the western grass-stem sawfly, was originally only found within native grasses throughout North America, existing in alongside B. cephi and B. lissogaster (Ainslie, 1920; Cárcamo et al., 2012). However, as agriculture increased and native grasses were replaced by large monoculture landscapes, the WSS moved into wheat (Farstad, 1940; Davis et al., 1955; Holmes, 1978) while the parasitoids were slower to adapt (Morrill et al., 1998)."

    "text": "Biology of Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster\n\nAdult\nBoth B. cephi and B. lissogaster are protelean host-specific parasitoids with two generations per year (bivoltine) (Nelson and Farstad, 1953; Somsen and Luginbill, 1956; Holmes et al., 1963). They are ectoparasitoids and idiobionts, living on the integument of their hosts and immediately paralyzing their hosts in location and stage it was when it was attacked (Nelson and Farstad, 1953; Runyon et al., 2002b; Weaver et al., 2004). Male parasitoids are approximately 3.5 mm in length, while females are 4.1 mm. They are dark red, with black antennae, eyes, ovipositor and ocelli (Gahan, 1918). B. lissogaster and B. cephi are distinguishable by their head color and unique metasoma surface texture (Runyon et al., 2001). Adults emerge after completing a pupal stage within the host stem by chewing a hole through the stem wall. In Montana, the first generations are present from late June to late July, while the second generations are active in August and September (Somsen and Luginbill, 1956). Adult female B. cephi and B. lissogaster will locate a host stem using a combination of olfactory and volatile cues. The wasps will then locate a host sawfly larva using acoustic cues (Mankin et al., 2004) and use their ovipositor first paralyze, then deposit 1-4 eggs next to the paralyzed larva.\n\n\nEgg\nB. cephi and B. lissogaster eggs are on average 0.86 mm in length, exhibiting an elongated shape and pale-yellow color. Females lay one to three eggs on the WSS larval integument or adjacent to the larva. The eggs develop for one to three days before hatching (Nelson and Farstad, 1953; Somsen and Luginbill, 1956).\n\n\nLarva\nParasitoid larvae are 1mm in length, with a translucent hue that turns increasingly brown as the larva progresses through five instar stages (Nelson and Farstad, 1953). The newly hatched larvae have no appendages, save for antennae, and they exhibit highly sclerotized mouthparts and well-developed mandibles. After hatching, the B. lissogaster larva attach themselves to the integument of the host larva and immediately begin feeding (Somsen and Luginbill, 1956). When feeding is complete, little remains of the host but the integument. Following feeding, the larva will spin a lightly brown colored cocoon over the course of several days and attach to the inside wall of the host plant stem. The larval stage takes an average of ten days between initial hatch and cocoon completion. Because there are two generations per year, the early summer offspring will hatch and emerge from the host stem. Offspring laid as a part of the second generation will overwinter within the cocoons and emerge in the spring. (Nelson and Farstad, 1953)\n\n\nWSS and Parasitoid Interactions with Smooth Brome\nBhandari (2020) has shown that oviposition occurs with similar frequency in wheat as it does in smooth brome, however, we see much higher rates of larval mortality within smooth brome stems. This has led researchers to hypothesize about the feasibility of using smooth brome as a trap cop (Perez-Mendoza et al., 2006; Lesieur et al., 2016). While feasible as a feed crop, as it holds considerably less economic value compared to wheat or other high value crops (Criddle, 1922). Smooth brome may be usable in trap strips along the edge of wheat fields (Hokkanen and Jokioinen, 1991). While a poor host for the wheat stem sawfly, surviving immature larvae found within brome stems can be parasitized by B. cephi and B. lissogaster. This combination of factors may indicate that smooth brome can function as a WSS sink and a parasitoid source, with very few WSS emerging from smooth brome patches, while also supporting populations of parasitoids that can then parasitize WSS in adjacent wheat fields."

    "text": "Plant Semiochemicals\nPlants interact with other organisms through a complex system of chemical signals known as Semiochemicals. Semiochemicals are compounds or mixtures of compounds that are released from one organism that evoke a physiological or behavior response in another organism (Agelopoulos et al., 1999). Semiochemicals play a large role in both insect-insect and plant-insect interactions and are essential in insects locating feedings sites, mating sites, egg-laying sites, and/or refugia (Prokopy et al., 1984). While it is known that these chemicals play an important role in communication between plants, insects, and other organisms, there is still debate about the function of many of them (Reddy and Guerrero, 2004; Voelckel and Jander, 2018).\n\nSemiochemicals in Plant-Insect Systems\nWithin plant-insect systems, plants respond to insect herbivory by synthesizing and releasing volatile compounds and providing important signals to biocontrol agents to localize potential host insects (Sharma et al., 2019). In addition, semiochemicals provide localized signatures that allow insects to detect food sources, find mates, and locate preferential oviposition sites (Norin, 2007). Plants typically produce semiochemicals when defending themselves from herbivorous arthropods (Guerrieri et al., 1999) or pathogen attacks (Smart et al., 2014 Jan 1). These responses can be grouped into two categories, direct and indirect responses. Direct responses are compounds that the plant produces that have a direct effect on the herbivore or pathogen (Metcalf, 1998). Indirect responses are the compounds produced that have no impact directly on the pest, but instead may attract parasitoids, predators, or other biological control agents (Mayland et al., 2000; Colazza et al., 2004)."

Cut stubble, which contained WSS larvae in diapause, were kept in a refrigerator between 0-4 C for &gt;100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. After completing diapause, immature WSS were kept at room temperature between 22-27 C for 4-5 weeks in sealed 70 cm x 35 cm x 20 cm plastic Tupperware bins to allow for pupation and emergence. Once emergence began, adults were collected daily and sorted in 2-liter glass mason jars sealed with filter paper to allow for airflow. Jars containing adults were refrigerated at 6-10C until they were needed for experiments. Unused adults were discarded after 48 hours of refrigeration.\n\n\nPlants\nSmooth brome was grown from transplanted plants harvested from the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38’19.39”N, 116°14’28.86”W). Immediately following collection, plants were transplanted into 2.7 x 14 inch lightweight deepot cells (Stuewe & Sons Inc, Tangent, OR) and moved into the greenhouse. Wheat was grown using ‘Yellowstone’ winter wheat cultivar seed stock, started in 1 x 8 inch conical pots. The soil used consisted of MSU Plant Growth Center soil mix (equal parts sterilized Bozeman silt loam soil and washed concrete sand with Canadian sphagnum peat moss incorporated) and Sunshine Mix 1 (Canadian sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite, perlite, and Dolomite lime) in a 1:1 ratio. Fertilization was undergone once weekly using Jack’s Professional® Water-Soluble Fertilizer (20-20-20) (J.R. Peters Inc., Allentown, PA, USA).

After the plants reached Zadoks 12, they were moved into vernalization storage for 6 weeks to experience the length of dormancy needed for successful flower development. After the six-week period, wheat stems were transplanted into the larger, 2.7 x 14-inch Stuewe & Sons, Inc conical pots.\n\n\nVolatile Collection\nVolatile compounds were collected from intact and healthy smooth brome and Yellowstone winter wheat. Collection was undergone on plants at Zadoks 49, for a period of six hours from 09:00 to 15:00. Collections were undergone three times a week, with twelve plants collected from each time. Each trial consisted of six smooth brome plants and six winter wheat, with four of each being infested, while the other two were controls.\nVolatiles were collected from twelve plants per day using glass VCC’s that were 80 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. The top end of each VCC funneled into a threaded port that was 10 cm in diameter. Threaded onto the top of each VCC was an eight-port manifold adapter. Two glass filters (traps) (6.35 mm diameter x 76 mm length; Analytical Research Systems, Gainesville, FL) with 30 mg of Super-Q absorbent (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) were inserted into two of the adapter ports. The remaining six collection ports were sealed to prevent ambient air exchange and pressure loss. One of the traps was used to collected extraneous volatiles from the initial experiment set up for the first ten minutes, whereas the other trap was used to collect volatile compounds emanating from plants beginning ten minutes after the system was turned on. An air source was connected to the base of each collection chamber with supply from charcoal air filters. A vacuum pump was used to maintain air pressure and flow rate (humidified air at 1.0 liter/min) within the collection system. A small piece of cotton encompassed by a Teflon® guillotine was used at the base of each plant to tightly seal the base of the system and prevent external air from entering. Laboratory tape was used to seal the edges of the guillotine and prevent contamination by ambient and soil derived volatiles.\nVolatile collection and successive GC-MS analysis were conducted following methods described in Weaver et al. (2009). Glass volatile collection traps were eluted using 200 µL of dichloromethane into 2 mL screw top vials (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), followed by a slow release of nitrogen to further clear the volatile trap. 10 µL of nonyl acetate solution was added to the eluted solution as internal standard to quantify compounds. Samples were then subject to gas chromatography (GC) on a J&W HP – 5ms; 30m x 0.25 µm film thickness column (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The GC unit (Agilent 6890; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was paired with a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent 5973 instrument). Samples were injected into the column in pulse splitless mode, with the initial pressure of 82.7 kPa/m."

Bioassays were conducted using plants at growth stage Zadoks 49. The Y-tube system (Analytical Rsearch Systems, Micanopy, FL) used was similar as described in a previous study (Daisy et al., 2002) (Figure 1).

The fiber optic illuminator was used to deliver light to both arms equally from the center of the bifurcation, while the Teflon tubing connected the VCC to the arms of the Y-tube. One arm of the Y-tube delivered volatiles from the enclosed plant while the other delivered filtered, pure air as a control. The movement of adult WSS is positively phototactic and the horizontally placed Y-tube was positioned such that the light distribution towards both arms was balanced to avoid bias. The arms of the Y-tube were oriented to minimize directional bias and the position of the plants was alternated between runs. For each assay, a single naïve female B. cephi or B. lissogaster parasitoid was introduced 1 cm into the unbranched end of the Y-tube. A 28-cm wire was used to facilitate parasitoid movement from the unbranched stem of the glass Y-tube to the test junction between the two upper arms. The order of individual test insects from a pool of naïve females was randomly assigned for each bioassay, and test plants were chosen randomly from the greenhouse culture before each experiment. All glassware was cleaned using dish soap and warm water, followed by solvent rinses with acetone and hexane. Cleaned and rinsed glassware was baked at 110C in a glassware oven for 24 hours before use. New plants were used for each experiment. Each individual parasitoid was allowed three minutes to respond to either airstream source. Once a positive response was determined to either source, the trail was ended. If no choice was made after five minutes, the trail was ended and the result was recorded as no response."

    "text": "Volatile Collection\n\nSawfly Infestation\nWinter wheat plants were deemed ready for infestation once they reached Zadoks 49. Both smooth brome and winter wheat plants were infested by placing a transparent plastic cylinder (60 x 3.8 cm) over the main stem of the plant. A 55-60 cm bamboo stick was added within each tube to help prevent toppling of the cylinder. Each cage had three holes, as well as an open top, covered with fine mesh cloth to allow for air circulation. Four females and two male WSS, newly emerged, were introduced into each tube via a small 1 cm opening. After which, the hole was plugged using a cotton ball covered in mesh cloth. Damp soil was mounded around the base of each tube to prevent insect escapees. Adult sawflies were left within infestation tubes for three days, after which the tubes were removed, and any surviving insects, as well as cadavers, were removed. After infestation, the plants were returned to normal water and fertilization schedules.\nInfestation was undertaken three days a week, for five weeks. Each replicate included 6 ‘Yellowstone’ winter wheat plants at Zadoks 49 and 6 smooth brome plants exhibiting three nodes. For each replicate, three wheat and three smooth brome plants were infested, with three of each left uninfested. Infestation tubes were placed around all twelve plants to maintain control.\n\n\nVolatile Compound Collection\nVolatile compounds were collected from intact and healthy smooth brome and ‘Yellowstone’ winter wheat. Collection was undergone on plants at Zadoks 49, for a period of six hours from 10:00 to 16:00. Collections were undergone three times a week, with twelve plants collected from each time. Each trail consisted of six smooth brome plants and six winter wheat, with three of each being infested, while the other three were a control.\nVolatiles were collected from twelve plants per day using glass VCC’s that were 80 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. Volatile collection and successive GC-MS analysis were conducted following methods described in Weaver et al. (2009). The top end of each VCC funneled into a threaded port that was 10 cm in diameter. Threaded onto the top of each VCC was an eight-port manifold adapter. Two glass filters (traps) (6.35 mm diameter x 76 mm length; Analytical Research Systems, Gainesville, FL) with 30 mg of Super-Q absorbent (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) were inserted into two of the adapter ports. The remaining six collection ports were sealed to prevent ambient air exchange and pressure loss. One of the traps was used to collected extraneous volatiles from the initial experiment set up for the first ten minutes, whereas the other trap was used to collect volatile compounds emanating from plants beginning ten minutes after the system was turned on. A vacuum pump was used to maintain air pressure and flow rate (humidified air at 1.0 liter/min) within the collection system. A Teflon guillotine was used at the base of each plant to tightly seal the base of the system and prevent external air from entering. Each plant stem was wrapped with a small piece of cotton prior to the application of the guillotine to further seal the base of the collection system and prevent contamination by ambient and soil derived volatiles.\n\n\nVolatile Elution\nVolatile compounds were eluted from the glass traps using 200 L aliquot dichloromethane. Trapped volatiles were eluted slowly by adding dichloromethane and further clearing by using a slow release of nitrogen gas. The eluted samples were collected in a glass insert held within a 1.5-mL crimped top glass vial. 10 L of nonyl acetate were then added to the eluted samples as internal standard to quantify compound concentrations. The samples were processed using gas chromatography (GC) on a HP – 5MS; 30m x 0.25mm, 0.25 m film thickness column; (J and W Scientific, Folsom, CA). In order to analyze, the GC instrument (Agilent 6890; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent 5973 instrument). Each sample was injected using the automated system in pulse splitless mode, with the initial pressure set to 82.7 kPa per minute. The inlet temperature of the GC was set to 250C while the column temperature was 50C for 4 minutes. The temperature was set to increase at a rate of 5C per minute until it reached 160C, after which it increased to a rate of 25C per minute until it reached 280C. The temperature of the transfer line leading to the mass selective detector (MSD) was set at 300C. Helium was used as a carrier gas to maintain the flow rate of samples within the column at 1.2 mL/min. The MSD was set in ‘SCAN’ mode running from 50 – 300 m/z.\n\n\nVolatile Analysis\nThe compounds collected from both the smooth brome and wheat samples were identified by comparing mass spectra and retention times using the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) library. Peaks and volatiles were analyzed using MSD ChemStation (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The data obtained from the mass-spectrometer was transferred to a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet where the compounds were quantified by comparison with the internal standard peak area. The amount obtained for each compound was then transformed to the amount produced in six hours. The true quantity of compounds was calculated relative to the internal standard.\n\n\nElectroantennogram\nSpecimens were prepared by excising the head from the body using fine micro-dissection scissors. For each specimen, a micro-capillarity tube was pulled in half using a pipette puller (Model PP-830, Narishige Scientific Instrument Lab, Tokyo, Japan). Each half was cut to the appropriate length and angle, then filled with saline solution. The parasitoid head was mounted on the broken end of one of the capillary tubes, then the tube was place on one of the conducting electrode wires connected to a micromanipulator, type INR-5 (Narishige MN-151). The second half of the capillary tube was place on the other electrode wire, and one insect antennae was positioned to touch the empty capillary tube, thus connecting the circuit. The amplifier transferred the information to a computer interface with an EAG version 2.7 software (Syntech NL 2001, Hilversum, Netherlands). This apparatus and method has been consistently used previously in assessing insect volatile response (Agelopoulos et al., 1999).\nA consistent stream of purified, humidified air (20 mL sec-1) was delivered onto the antennae. The test compound was delivered via airborne stimulus released from a glass pipette with filter paper treated with 10 L of the test compound. The pipette was connected to a Stimulus Controller CS-55 (Syntech NL 2010, Hilversum, The Netherlands). The equipment was programmed to deliver a 0.4 second puff of air through a Teflon tube and through the glass pipette. The electrical response of the antenna to the test compound was detected by the recording electrode and transferred to the amplifier, increasing the signal and delivering the information to the computer.

In Montana alone, the economic damage caused by the pest was reported to be upwards of $80 million annually between 2011-2016 (Fulbright et al. 2017). Current techniques in combatting the damage caused by the WSS use a variety of chemical, cultural, and biocontrol strategies with limited short-term effectiveness and long-term sustainability. Utilizing biological control via promoting braconid parasitoid habitat holds considerable value to both growers and agricultural observers. As we seek to increase agricultural yields, we must also consider the environmental impact that tactics such as pesticides and tillage have on the future success on wheat farming.",

Native to North America (Lesieur et al. 2016), the largest populations of WSS are currently found in the western Canadian prairies as well as Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, and North and South Dakota (Wallace and McNeal 1966; Weiss and Morrill 1992; Cockrell et al. 2021).",

    "section": "Host Plants of Wheat Stem Sawfly",
    "text": "Host Plants of Wheat Stem Sawfly\nWheat stem sawfly was first found the hollow-stemmed wild grasses such as Agropyron and Elymus in Colorado in 1872 (Ainslie 1920). Soon thereafter it was found in wheat in 1895 in Manitoba, Canada. First referred to as the “western-grass stem sawfly”, WSS was found with native Montana grasses including western wheatgrass (Pascopyrun smithii) and slender wheat grass (Elymus trachycaulus) (Ainslie 1920). As settlers began moving west and small grain cereal crop production increased on the landscape, the native grasses that WSS foraged upon became quite rare (Ainslie 1929). WSS was found damaging spring wheat for the first time in 1895 in Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Wallace and McNeal 1966). With the diminishment of its natural hosts, WSS has adapted to infest the exotic non-cultivated and cultivated grasses now present (Norman Criddle 1923). WSS infestation has been shown in many species native to Montana including western wheatgrass (Pascopyrun smithii), slender wheat grass (Elymus trachycaulus) and bluebunch wheatgrass, Pseudoroegneria spicata (Cockrell et al. 2021).\nSmooth brome (Bromus inermis L.) is a Eurasian cool-season rhizomatous grass introduced to the United States in 1884 from Hungary and Russia for soil conservation and use as livestock feed (Salesman and Jessica 2011). Throughout the early 19th and 20th century, it was used throughout much of the upper half of North America. It is a perennial grass, and more drought resistant than other exotic grasses (Mapfumo et al. 2002). Due to its sod forming nature and large root system, it is extensively used to promote soil retention along highways (USDA-NRCS 2010).\nSmooth brome was originally thought of as potentially useful as a trap crop in order to combat the growing WSS problem with cultural control practices (Farstad and Jacobson 1945). However, due to its propensity to form monocultures and outcompete many native grasses, smooth brome was labeled by many as invasive (I. T. Carlson and Newell 1985; Willson and Stubbendieck 2000; Dillemuth, Rietschier, and Cronin 2008). Smooth brome populations play a considerable role in altering native herbivore population dynamics and movement on the prairies of North America (Dillemuth, Rietschier, and Cronin 2008).",

    "section": "Biology of Wheat Stem Sawfly",
    "text": "Biology of Wheat Stem Sawfly\n\nAdult\nAdults are relatively small (8-13 mm) with a narrow elongated and slightly compressed black body, yellow legs, and three characteristic black bands across the abdomen. Females are larger than males and a visible long, dark, ovipositor. Both male and female adults are weak fliers, rarely flying long distances at one time (Norman Criddle 1923). They can be found on stems with their heads downward and legs aligned with their body, encircling the stem (Ainslie 1920; Norman Criddle 1923). WSS are univoltine, having only one generation per year. Males are haploid (9 chromosomes), while females are diploid – females who do not find a mate will produce male offspring, while those who do produce female progeny (Holmes 1978). Fully mature adults hatch in the spring once it has sufficiently warmed and the moisture levels in the soil reach threshold levels (Holmes 1978; Perez-Mendoza and Weaver 2006). In Montana, this period begins in mid- to late-May and ends early in July (W. L. Morrill and Kushnak 1996; David K. Weaver et al. 2005). Their lifespan usually lasts around five to eight days, emerging from May until June. Males emerge before the females, ensuring that many of the early females to hatch will find a mate and deposit eggs that will be female (Mackay 2011). Copulation lasts less than one minute with the male holding the back of the female with their abdomen curved down under the female ovipositor. Fertilized females lay eggs several hours after copulation (Holmes 1978).\n\n\nOviposition\nAfter locating a suitable host stem, female WSS oviposit an egg inside the host plant lumen. WSS larvae hatch inside the stem and feed on the stem’s parenchyma tissue (Beres et al. 2011). As the stem begins to senesce in the fall, the larvae travel to the base of the stem and makes a V-shaped groove (Norman Criddle 1923) above a constructed protective hibernaculum where they will overwinter (Holmes and Peterson 1960). As a result of this deep groove, the stem weakens and topples easily. The resulting lodged stems are not only challenging for growers to harvest but also exhibit decreased kernel yield (Beres et al. 2011).\n\n\nEgg\nNewly laid eggs are crescent in shape, milky-white in color, and range between 1 mm to 1.25 mm in length and 0.33 to 0.42 mm wide (Ainslie 1920). After oviposition, the egg lies freely within the lumen of the host stem or in a hollow created by the female WSS ovipositor (Fulbright et al. 2017). Laval development occurs rapidly with the recognizable shape becoming apparent at day three. By day five, the jaws turn brown as the eye spots begin to appear and darken. By day six or seven, the larva begins to hatch using a series of convulsive movements and emerges into the stem cavity, with full functionality achieved by the seventh day (Ainslie 1920).\n\n\nLarvae\nAfter hatching and prior to feeding, the larvae are transparent and colorless (Ainslie 1920; Norman Criddle 1923). WSS larvae are distinguishable from other larvae feeding in wheat and grasses by their highly sclerotized head capsule and large body size (Nelson and Farstad 1953). As the larvae chew their way through the parenchymous and vascular tissues of the host stem, the larvae begin to develop a yellow-green color. As the larvae progress through the stem, they excrete frass; the digested plant tissue as well as metabolic breakdown products from the WSS (Beres et al. 2011). If multiple eggs are laid within the same stem, the largest (usually the first egg laid and hatched) will typically remain within a few weeks due to the larvae cannibalizing one another (Norman Criddle 1923; Seamans, Manson, and Farstad 1944; Buteler et al. 2015). It remains unknown whether the consumption of other eggs and larvae is the result of intentional cannibalism or the indirect result of indiscriminate feeding (Buteler et al. 2015). As the host plant physiologically matures, and the larvae reaches its fifth instar, the insect is cued to travel to the base of stem and prepare for obligatory diapause (Beres et al. 2011). The descending movement of larvae and development of the hibernaculum are triggered by the host plant senescence. As the stem walls becoming increasingly transparent, they allow increased amounts of visible and infrared light into the stem (Holmes 1977; Beres et al. 2011). Once the larvae reach the base of the stem, they construct an interior V-shaped groove, making the stem weak enough to lodge due to gravity or wind (Norman Criddle 1923). The larvae then plug the remaining stub with frass to insulate the hibernaculum during diapause (Holmes and Peterson 1960). The larval stage of development can be as short as 30 days before entering diapause. Obligatory diapause lasts a minimum of 90 days (Salt and Hollick 1947). After the larvae are exposed to temperatures less than 10°C for 90 days, diapause is complete, and pupation can begin. Larvae can reenter diapause if temperatures approach 35°C (Salt and Hollick 1947) or if conditions are abnormally dry (Holmes 1978) shortly after termination of diapause.\n\n\nPupae\nOnce diapause is complete, pupal development begins. Pupation lasts for 21 days, beginning in early- to mid-May (Norman Criddle 1923). Initially, the pupa is milky-white in color (Ainslie 1920), gradually changing to bright white as the wings develop (Fulbright et al. 2017). Additionally, as development continues, characteristic brown and black eye spots appear on the surface of the pupae. Once pupation is complete, the adult sawfly will chew through either the frass plug or the side of the stub, and emerge ready for flight (Ainslie 1920; Holmes and Peterson 1960).",

As a result, vascular translocation of water and nutrients within the plant is impaired (Macedo, Weaver, and Peterson 2007) and causes a notable reduction yield and quality of the grain produced (Seamans, Manson, and Farstad 1944; Holmes 1977; Wendell L. Morrill et al. 1992). In addition, the weakening of the stem due to WSS causes lodging prior to harvest, exacerbated by larvae stem girdling. Stem lodging causes a reduction in stem harvest efficiently (Ainslie 1920), with yield lost due to unrecoverable lodged stem (Beres, Cárcamo, and Byers 2007). Additionally, the reduction in stubble residues decreases snow retention which increases soil erosion and reduces soil moisture content (Keren et al. 2015).",

    "text": "Management of Wheat Stem Sawfly\n\nChemical Control\nBecause WSS are stem mining pests and spend most of their lives within the host plant stem, the use of traditional pest control methods such as insecticides have proven to be ineffective. The only life stage of WSS that takes place outside of the stem, the adult, is not targetable via chemical treatment due to adult emergence and oviposition taking place over many weeks (Knodel, Shanower, and Beauzay 2010; Beres et al. 2011). WSS infestation chemical control methods were first tested as early as 1949 (Wallace 1962). After using six different organochlorine and organophosphate insecticidal dust applied via a powder duster (Munro, Nostdahl, and Post 1949) the authors found “unsatisfactory results that did not control” WSS populations or limit infestations. In 1963, it was reported that a 73% control of WSS infestation could be achieved via granular heptachlor applied in the furrow with the wheat seed (Wallace 1962). However, the findings of these tests were not able to be replicable in all scenarios of WSS infestation (Holmes et al. 1963). Heptachlor required light sawfly infestation – restricted to the lower internodes – to be effective. When infestation rates were high, and oviposition occurred in the upper internodes, the researchers saw little to no control. Similar results were found when testing with foliar insecticides, findings showing little differences in their effect when compared to controls (Blodgett et al. 1996). While the Montana Department of Agriculture has authorized the use of systemic organophosphate insecticide phorate (Thimet®) for use controlling WSS infestation in winter and spring wheat cultivars, it’s use is not considered environmentally friendly due to high toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish. Additionally, a preharvest interval of 85 days complicates harvest scheduling (Ginsberg, 2003; Mahajan et al., 2006), while the high toxicity may have potential adverse effects on beneficial parasitoid populations (Andrea C. Varella et al. 2016).\n\n\nCultural Control\n\nHost Plant Resistance\nMechanisms like antixenosis, antibiosis, and tolerance give a plant the ability to resist insect pests (Horber 1980; Wilson et al. 1987). Antixenosis allows the host plant to trigger resistance by inducing non-preference in herbivores when they attempt to feed or oviposit. Recent work done by Achhami et al. (2020) found that Barely cultivars that closely resemble wheat show the greatest frequency of WSS oviposition. These findings suggest that semiochemicals produced by these barley cultivars, such as (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (Piesik et al. 2008; Buteler, Weaver, and Peterson 2009) and (Z)-β-ocimene (Buteler and Weaver 2012), are likely similar to those produced by wheat (Achhami et al. 2020). Antibiosis causes the improper development of herbivores, impacting survivability and reproduction. Tolerance allows the host plant to withstand infestation and overcome injuries (Emden 1991; Zoeren and Guedot 2017). Much of the research done on WSS resistant wheat cultivars focuses on solid stem trait and pith expression (Platt and Farstad 1949; Andrea C. Varella et al. 2016; Andrea C. Varella et al. 2017). Solid stem varieties are more resistant to infestation, reducing WSS oviposition and increasing egg mortality (Holmes and Peterson 1960; Andrea C. Varella et al. 2016). The increased pith expression also disrupts larvae movement within the stem, leading to higher larval mortality due to reduced feeding as well as smaller and less reproductively successful adults (Wallace and McNeal 1966). In addition, greater pith expression increases stem strength, reducing losses due to lodged stems (Delaney, Weaver, and Peterson 2010). Additional factors including late planting and shorter crop duration, have been suggested as potential factors complicating antixenosis, leading to increased WSS oviposition and infestation (Achhami et al. 2020). The solid-stemmed trait has been developed in numerous spring and some winter wheat cultivars (Beres et al. 2011). While the use of solid-stemmed cultivars is most often recommended for WSS management (Beres et al. 2011), hollow-stemmed cultivars were found to exhibit greater parasitism when compared to solid-stemmed varieties (Holmes et al. 1963). It was previously suggested by Rand et al. (2012) that the thicker pith found in solid-stemmed cultivars makes sensing WSS larvae vibrations (Mankin et al. 2004) more difficult for female parasitoids. The inability to locate WSS hosts would then cause ineffective parasitism.\n\n\nTillage\nTillage is a potential control method for the WSS. Larvae are protected against both water loss and freezing temperatures by the soil surrounding the wheat stubble where the WSS overwinters. Tilling the soil exposes the wheat stubble to the soil surface, conditions which kill the hibernating larvae (Callenback and Hansmeier 1944). Tillage of the WSS has been shown to be effective in decreasing the pest’s populations in both spring and winter wheat cultivars. Upwards of 90% mortality has been shown in North Dakota after fall tillage (Weiss, Morrill, and Reitz 1987). Many factors influence the effectiveness of tilling, including adequate exposure of wheat stubs on the soil surface and appropriate timing (Holmes and Farstad 1956; Wendell L. Morrill et al. 1992; Weiss and Morrill 1992). While the variability in effectiveness exists, some growers do consider it a crucial management tool (Blodgett et al. 1996; Lesieur et al. 2016).\nWhile effective in killing WSS larvae, there are negative impacts caused by this practice. Water loss, soil compaction, and erosion have all been shown to be dramatically increased by tilling activities (Phillips et al. 1980; Lal 1991). In addition, tilling practices negatively impact beneficial populations of parasitoid wasps that target the WSS. WSS parasitoids overwinter higher in the stem compared to at the base like WSS (Wendell L. Morrill, Kushnak, and Gabor 1998; Runyon et al. 2002). By displacing soil when tilling, the upper portion of the plant is buried under the soil, preventing the parasitoid wasps from emerging in the spring (Runyon et al. 2002; David K. Weaver, Runyon, and Morrill 2004).\n\n\nPlant Density and Spacing\nHistorically, it has been observed that wheat fields with wider row spacing (12 inches) have greater WSS cutting when compared to fields with reduced spacing (3 to 6 inches). Additionally, fields planted at greater seed density with solid stem cultivars exhibit lower WSS cutting compared to reduced seed density (Luginbill and McNeal 1958). The reason for this relationship between decreased density and increased sawfly infestation is due to the moisture availability and height of the wheat stems. At higher densities, each stem has access to less water, in turn leading to the stem to develop a thicker pith – more solid stemmed. As discussed above, there is a negative linear relationship between an increase in the solid-stem characteristic and infestation (Kemp 1934).\n\n\nCrop Rotation\nContinually planting wheat year after year creates ideal conditions for the WSS (Callenbach and Hansmeier 1945). Rotating wheat with more resistant wheat varieties as well as with oats, or soybeans (crops that are less or not susceptible to WSS infestation) is recommended to decrease the year after year WSS infestation rates (Lin and Chen 2014). The notable downside to utilizing crop rotation in a matter that is effective is the economic downside. Alternate-year, summer fallow production systems are typical for wheat growing practices across much of the northern great plains of the United States (Weiss and Morrill 1992; Troeh, Hobbs, and Donahue 1999).\n\n\nTrap Crops\nTrap cropping utilized non-economically important plantings to help reduce populations or block movement of pests into valuable crop areas (Hokkanen and Jokioinen 1991). Effective trap crops of the WSS should have appealing characteristics to the WSS to attract the pest to the trap planting, and away from the wheat (Farstad 1940). Historically, planted trap strips were used by attracting sawflies and destroying the strip at the end of the season, eliminating the larvae (Wendell L. Morrill et al. 1992). However, utilizing trap plantings of highly attractive wheat varieties has been shown to hold limited viability, as growers are not fond of destroying planted grain at the end of the growing season (Goosey 1999).\nAlternative utilization of WSS traps entail planting and/or maintaining strips of smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) or other WSS host grasses (Farstad 1940). Smooth brome in particular holds potential as it is a poor host to WSS larvae (Bhandari 2020), yet WSS adults continue to oviposit the stems. This relationship of greater oviposition with increased mortality may lead to decreases in overall WSS populations.\n\n\nDelayed Planting & Swathing\nWheat planted later in the growing season avoids much of the damage caused by the WSS as the wheat reaches stem elongation after many of the adult sawflies have already laid their eggs (Jacobson and Farstad 1952). The problem with delayed planting is that the practice is known to make less efficient use the earl season moisture in the soil (W. L. Morrill and Kushnak 1996). Growers may need to weigh the tradeoffs in delayed planting to reduce losses in areas with a history of severe infestation. Swathing, also known as windrowing, is the practice of cutting the wheat to accelerate the drying process and decrease the losses caused by WSS cutting (Holmes and Peterson 1965; C. G. Carlson 2019; McCullough, Hein, and Bradshaw 2020). By cutting the wheat and letting it dry prior to sawfly cutting, swathing works by reducing losses due to lodging (Ainslie 1920).\n\n\nBiological Control Methods\nThe use of biocontrol in limiting WSS populations has been well studied with variable results. There are currently three types of organisms that have been reported as biocontrol agents of the WSS in wheat fields: Soil fungal pathogens, the predatory beetle Phyllobaenus dubius, and two parasitic Hymenoptera.\n\n\nSoil Fungal Pathogens\nFungal pathogens are found throughout both the plant and animal kingdoms. Several fungi have been shown to negatively impact WSS larvae infestation within wheat stems. While highly lethal to sawfly larvae, F. graminearum, F. acuminatum, F. equiseti, and F. avenaceum also cause crown rot in the host plant. The trade-off between WSS control and crown rot may limit Fusarium spp. usefulness to WSS management. (Wenda-Piesik et al. 2009). Findings by Tangtrakulwanich et al. (2014) found that the fungi B. bassiana and M. brunneum effectively reduced damage caused by WSS. Both fungi kill insects by infecting via spore contact or by insect consumption of treated plant tissue (Portman et al. 2018).\n\n\nPredatory Beetle\nPhyllobaenus dubius (Wolcott) has been observed emerging from wheat stubble and within dissected wheat stems in Montana (Wendell L. Morrill et al. 2001). Further research is required on this coleopteran to determine its prospects going forward as an effective WSS management tool.\n\n\nParasitoids of the Wheat Stem Sawfly\nTwo parasitoid wasps are known target the wheat stem sawfly in wheat fields. The congeneric parasitoids, Bracon cephi (Gahan) and B. lissogaster Muesebeck, are the most effective agents of WSS biological control (Runyon et al. 2001). B. cephi and B. lissogaster, as distinguished by Runyon et al. (2001), were initially limited in their ability to parasitize WSS larvae within wheat stems. The wheat stem sawfly, originally known as the western grass-stem sawfly, was originally only found within native grasses throughout North America, existing in alongside B. cephi and B. lissogaster [Ainslie (1920); Cárcamo et al., 2012). However, as agriculture increased and native grasses were replaced by large monoculture landscapes, the WSS moved into wheat [Farstad (1940); Davis, Benton, and Somsen (1955); Holmes1978] while the parasitoids were slower to adapt (Wendell L. Morrill, Kushnak, and Gabor 1998).",

    "text": "Biology of Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster\n\nAdult\nBoth B. cephi and B. lissogaster are protelean host-specific ectoparasitoids with two generations per year (bivoltine) (Nelson and Farstad 1953; Somsen and Luginbill 1956; Holmes et al. 1963). They are ectoparasitoids and idiobionts, living on the integument of their hosts and immediately paralyzing their hosts in location and stage it was when it was attacked (Nelson and Farstad 1953; Runyon et al. 2002; David K. Weaver, Runyon, and Morrill 2004). Male parasitoids are approximately 3.5 mm in length, while females are 4.1 mm. They are dark red, with black antennae, eyes, ovipositor and ocelli (Gahan 1918). B. lissogaster and B. cephi are distinguishable by their head color and unique metasoma surface texture (Runyon et al. 2001). Adults emerge after completing a pupal stage within the host stem by chewing a hole through the stem wall. In Montana, the first generations are present from late June to late July, while the second generations are active in August and September (Somsen and Luginbill 1956). Adult female B. cephi and B. lissogaster will locate a host stem using a combination of olfactory and volatile cues. The wasps will then locate a host sawfly larva using acoustic cues (Mankin et al. 2004) and use their ovipositor first paralyze, then deposit 1-4 eggs next to the paralyzed larva.\n\n\nEgg\nB. cephi and B. lissogaster eggs are on average 0.86 mm in length, exhibiting an elongated shape and pale-yellow color. Females lay one to three eggs on the WSS larval integument or adjacent to the larva. The eggs develop for one to three days before hatching (Nelson and Farstad 1953; Somsen and Luginbill 1956).\n\n\nLarva\nParasitoid larvae are 1mm in length, with a translucent hue that turns increasingly brown as the larva progresses through five instar stages (Nelson and Farstad 1953). The newly hatched larvae have no appendages, save for antennae, and they exhibit highly sclerotized mouthparts and well-developed mandibles. After hatching, the B. lissogaster larva attach themselves to the integument of the host larva and immediately begin feeding (Somsen and Luginbill 1956). When feeding is complete, little remains of the host but the integument. Following feeding, the larva will spin a lightly brown colored cocoon over the course of several days and attach to the inside wall of the host plant stem. The larval stage takes an average of ten days between initial hatch and cocoon completion. Because there are two generations per year, the early summer offspring will hatch and emerge from the host stem. Offspring laid as a part of the second generation will overwinter within the cocoons and emerge in the spring. (Nelson and Farstad 1953)\n\n\nWSS and Parasitoid Interactions with Smooth Brome\nBhandari (2020) has shown that oviposition occurs with similar frequency in wheat as it does in smooth brome, however, we see much higher rates of larval mortality within smooth brome stems. This has led researchers to hypothesize about the feasibility of using smooth brome as a trap cop (Perez-Mendoza and Weaver 2006; Lesieur et al. 2016). While feasible as a feed crop, as it holds considerably less economic value compared to wheat or other high value crops (N. Criddle 1922). Smooth brome may be usable in trap strips along the edge of wheat fields (Hokkanen and Jokioinen 1991). While a poor host for the wheat stem sawfly, surviving immature larvae found within brome stems can be parasitized by B. cephi and B. lissogaster. This combination of factors may indicate that smooth brome can function as a WSS sink and a parasitoid source, with very few WSS emerging from smooth brome patches, while also supporting populations of parasitoids that can then parasitize WSS in adjacent wheat fields.",

    "text": "Plant Semiochemicals\nPlants interact with other organisms through a complex system of chemical signals known as Semiochemicals. Semiochemicals are compounds or mixtures of compounds that are released from one organism that evoke a physiological or behavior response in another organism (Agelopoulos et al. 1999). Semiochemicals play a large role in both insect-insect and plant-insect interactions and are essential in insects locating feedings sites, mating sites, egg-laying sites, and/or refugia (Prokopy, Roitberg, and Averill 1984).\nWhile it is known that these chemicals play an important role in communication between plants, insects, and other organisms, there is still debate about the function of many of them (Reddy and Guerrero 2004; Voelckel and Jander 2018).\n\nSemiochemicals in Plant-Insect Systems\nWithin plant-insect systems, plants respond to insect herbivory by synthesizing and releasing volatile compounds and providing important signals to biocontrol agents to localize potential host insects (Sharma, Sandhi, and Reddy 2019). In addition, semiochemicals provide localized signatures that allow insects to detect food sources, find mates, and locate preferential oviposition sites (Norin 2007). Plants typically produce semiochemicals when defending themselves from herbivorous arthropods [Guerrieri1999] or pathogen attacks (Smart, Aradottir, and Bruce 2014). These responses can be grouped into two categories, direct and indirect responses. Direct responses are compounds that the plant produces that have a direct effect on the herbivore or pathogen (Metcalf 1998). Indirect responses are the compounds produced that have no impact directly on the pest, but instead may attract parasitoids, predators, or other biological control agents (Mayland, Margolies, and Charlton 2000; Colazza et al. 2004).",
