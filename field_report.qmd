# POST FARM

## Methods  

### Plant Selection and Cages

Assessment of C. cinctus infestation and mortality within B. inermis were assessed using a 34 x 60 ft plot at the Arthur H. Post Agronomy Farm (43°38'19.39"N, 116°14'28.86"W), an extension research station of Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. The cage structure was built using 1-inch PVC piping with the netting made using 530\(\mu\) Amber Lumite Screen (BioQuip® Products, LLC). Twelve cages were built to dimensions of 6ft x 3ft x 3ft (L x W x H) with cage locations selected randomly based on the space available within the plot and arranged in sets of three. The cages were removed from the plot after 3 weeks of sawfly release. 

### Insects  

Wheat stem stubble was collected in Three Forks, MT, USA (43°38'19.39"N, 116°14'28.86"W) from fields that experienced high levels of C. cinctus infestation and cutting in the prior year. Cut stubble, which contained C. cinctus larvae in diapause, were kept refrigerated between -2°C and 3°C for >100 days as required to complete obligatory larval diapause. As needed, stubs were removed from refrigeration and kept at 22-27°C for 4-5 weeks inside of 100 oz GladWare® storage containers (Glad®, Oakland, California USA). Stubs were added to cages once B. inermis stems reached six inches tall, with sawfly quantity treatments as follows: high (600 stubs), low (200 stubs), and control (0 stubs).

#### Data Collection  

Stems were collected from each cage site in late August. All stems from each 6 x 3 ft cage section were collected. Each stem was sliced open using X-Acto® knives to collect data on infestation, dead larvae, live larvae, and parasitism at each internode.

Let's take a closer look at the number of nodes borrowed through by the larvae. Using this information we can make an arguement about the size and length of time each larvae was alive prior to dying. This can be informative in understanding how many larvae would have been left later in the season for potential parasitism. 

#### Infestation Percentage/Node

```

Based on the results of our ANOVA, we have weak evidence (Pval = `r aov.df[3,5]`) to suggest there is a difference in the number of nodes infested when considering treatment group and vegetative and reproductive stems. 

```{r cumsum of infestation per node, echo = F, fig.align = "center"}

  mutate(stem.id = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(stem.id, site, rep, treatment, v.r, lar),

  dplyr::select(treatment, nodes.inf, cumsum) %>%
  mutate(nodes.inf = fct_rev(nodes.inf))
  

cumsum %>%
  mutate(cumsum = round(cumsum, 2)) %>%

  row_spec(0, background = "#f2f2f2") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" ", "# of Nodes Infested" = 6))


ggplot(data = cumsum,
         aes(x = nodes.inf,
             y = cumsum,

       color = "WSS Treatment \nLevel",
       title = "Smooth brome node infestation") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(levels(cumsum$cumsum)))

```
  
I like this plot because it shows the cumulative percentage sum of nodes infested at each node. For example, at the 3rd node in 2023, we see that close to 70% of the stems in the 'high' treatment group exhibited between 3 and 6 nodes infested. As a general thought exercise, the more nodes a larvae burrowed through, the larger the larvae. This means that if we classify a "large" larvae as one who burrowed through at least 4 nodes, our infestation data shows that 36% of the larvae in the 'high' treatment groups died as "large" larvae. 


```{r larvae breakdown, echo = F}
# how many stems had live larvae in them?
# percent of stems with each larval type

larvae.type <-
pf.inf.23 %>%
  dplyr::select(site, rep, treatment, 8:19) %>%
  mutate(stem.id = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(stem.id, site, rep, treatment, v.r, lar),
               names_to = "node",
               values_to = "node_status") %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(treatment, lar) %>%
  reframe(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(year = "2023") %>%
  left_join(pf.total.comb, by = c("treatment", "year")) %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  mutate(per = count/total) %>%
  filter(lar == "a") %>%
  mutate(per = round(per, 3))
# stems collected in late October. This is much later than if parasitoids were flying. 

kable(larvae.type[c("treatment", "count", "total", "per")],
      format = "html",
      align = "c",
      col.names = c("Treatment", "Count", "Total Stems", "%"),
      caption = "Stems with Living Larvae (2023)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered", 
                                      "hover", "repsonsive"),
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(0, background = "#f2f2f2")
```

Interesting to see that `r larvae.type[1,6]*100`% of stems in the 'high' treatment groups and `r larvae.type[2,6]*100`% of stems in the 'low' treatment group had living WSS larvae. The stems for this experiement were harvested in late October, much later in the season when we would expect the second generation parasitoids to be searching for a host.

# MONTANA FIELD SITES

## Methods  

To assess C cinctus infestation, larval mortality, and parasitoid prevalence within B. inermis and adjacent wheat fields, sites were chosen that had the best chance of accurately representing conditions throughout the Golden Triangle, a region of north-central Montana known for its dryland grain production. Samples were collected in both early July and late August in 2021, 2022, and 2023 from sites in Big Sandy, Moccasin, and Amsterdam, MT, USA. Sample locations were chosen by identifying fields with consistent wheat production that were adjacent to healthy B. inermis stands, either situated between fields or between fields and roadways. Polygons containing B. inermis were set up along the periphery of adjacent wheat fields, each covering an area of approximately 100 meters. Four collection squares of 1ft x 1ft were randomly selected within each polygon during both collection events each year. All stems within each 1 x 1 ft square were collected. The stems were then processed and split in the laboratory to assess infestation, live eggs, dead eggs, dead larvae, live larvae, parasitism, and cutting.

We saw very low levels of infestation in 2023 within the wheat. This was likely due a cold, mild spring that led to late stem development. Because the wheat was not well developed, the sawflies did not infest. This appears to have led to high infestation within the smooth brome. Will be interesting to compare to 2022 when stem elongation followed normal expected timelines. 


#### Lochy Property - Gardiner Road

![Gardiner Road, Big Sandy, MT (2023)](https://github.com/jstrand894/Website/blob/main/gardiner%20road-min.png?raw=true)

In 2022, Gardiner road underwent a major reconstruction with both ditches being regraded. This severely diminished the amount smooth brome found along the edge of the roadway.

  ggplot(aes(x = type, y = mean, fill = distance)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se,
                    ymax = mean + se),
                position = position_dodge(0.9),
                width = 0.2,
                alpha = 0.5) +

                              "poten" = "Potential Cut"))
```

Similar results to North Road seen here. Low infestation in the adjacent wheat field was due to the cool spring and lack of infestable stems during the sawfly flight. This shows that even in odd years like 2023, sawflies are still present in the smooth brome, meaning parasitoids will still have larval hosts.
