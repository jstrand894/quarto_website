   abstract = {Host plant traits strongly affect survivorship of insect herbivores, and host suitability is especially important for the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, which spends its entire egg, larval, and pupal periods in a single stem. Measuring larval survival inside stems from egg hatch through diapause-mediated dormancy is a potential measure of population size for the next year but is also useful in assessing effects of growing season precipitation and temperature. Larval growth is synchronized with host plant growth, and the larva cannot switch hosts. Thus, incorporating plant physiological time, as growing degree days (GDD), may yield a better prediction of larval survival. Therefore, we assessed wheat stem sawfly survival from early larval growth to the beginning of autumnal diapause in barley cultivars selected from across feed, forage, and two-or six-row malt groups. Field experiments were conducted in Gallatin and Chouteau counties, Montana, in 2016 and 2017. We used Kaplan-Meier estimation to assess larval survival among cultivars. We found that the survival of pre-diapause larvae was greatest in 'Hockett' (36.5%) and lowest in 'Celebration' (15.4%). Precipitation and temperature during the growing season affected temporal patterns for larval survival across study sites. Adjusting survivorship curves using site-specific GDD accumulation allowed cultivar-specific survivorship to be estimated more precisely for each site, despite differing environmental influences. Our findings suggest that measuring wheat stem sawfly survival across barley cultivars and standardizing by site-specific GDDs may provide better recommendations on barley cultivars that impede wheat stem sawfly population growth and reduce economic losses.},

   abstract = {Arthropods often have obligate relationships with symbiotic microbes, and recent investigations have demonstrated that such host-microbe relationships could be exploited to suppress natural populations of vector carrying mosquitos. Strategies that target the interplay between agricultural pests and their symbionts could decrease the burden caused by agricultural pests; however, the lack of comprehensive genomic insights into naturally occurring microbial symbionts presents a significant bottleneck. Here we employed amplicon surveys, genome-resolved metagenomics, and scanning electron microscopy to investigate symbionts of the wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus), a major pest that causes an estimated $350 million dollars or more in wheat yield losses in the northwestern United States annually. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing of two major haplotypes and life stages of wheat stem sawfly, we show a novel Spiroplasma species is ever-present and predominant, with phylogenomic analyses placing it as a member of the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Using state-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies we were able to reconstruct a 714 Kb, 72.7%-complete Spiroplasma genome, which represents just the second draft genome from the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Functional annotation of the Spiroplasma genome indicated carbohydrate-metabolism involved PTS-mediated import of glucose and fructose followed by glycolysis to lactate, acetate, and propionoate. The bacterium also encoded biosynthetic pathways for essential vitamins B2, B3, and B9. We identified putative Spiroplasma virulence genes: Cardiolipin and chitinase. These results identify a previously undescribed symbiosis between wheat stem sawfly and a novel Spiroplasma sp., availing insight into their molecular relationship, and may yield new opportunities for microbially-mediated pest control strategies.},

No difference in sawfly parasitism or sawfly-cut stems was found between fields bordering minimally tilled and fields bordering untilled summer fallow. Sawfly parasitism in fields bordering untilled summer fallow was greater than in fields bordering intensely tilled summer fallow at six of the eight sites examined. Sawfly-cut stems were greater in the field bordering intensely tilled fallow at four sites, with no difference in sawfly-cut stems between the intensely tilled and untilled field at the other four sites. Although it has never been reported, we have observed that many sawfly stubs are completely buried. Therefore, we measured the depth of sawfly stubs in four untilled fields in Broadwater County, MT. Two-thirds of the stubs were completely buried (206 of 300) with an average depth of 6 mm. Intensive tillage, which results in soil-covered stubble, is not an effective sawfly control practice, because sawflies typically overwinter below ground and upon emergence must dig to reach the soil surface. However, Bracon cephi (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck overwinter above ground in stems and might be unable to dig to the soil surface if buried. The elimination of intensive tillage in favor of chemical fallow should result in greater sawfly parasitism over time. Producers replacing minimal tillage with chemical fallow should see no effect on sawfly parasitism.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the dynamics of parasitism, host plant resistance, pathogens, and predation on the demography of wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), developing in susceptible (hollow stem) and resistant (solid stem) wheat hosts. This study is also the first to investigate the prevalence and impact of cannibalism on wheat stem sawfly mortality. Wheat stem sawflies were sampled in two commercial wheat fields over 4 yr from the egg stage through adult emergence, and multiple decrement life tables were constructed and analyzed. Cannibalism, host plant resistance, or unknown factors were the most prevalent factors causing egg mortality. Summer mortality of prediapause larvae ranged from 28 to 84%, mainly due to parasitism by Bracon cephi (Gaban) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck, cannibalism, and host plant resistance. Winter mortality ranged from 6 to 54% of the overwintering larvae, mainly due to unknown factors or pathogens. Cannibalism is a major cause of irreplaceable mortality because it is absolute, with only a single survivor in every multiple infested stem. Subsequent to obligate cannibalism, mortality of feeding larvae due to host plant resistance was lower in hollow stem wheat than in solid stem wheat. Mortality from host plant resistance was largely irreplaceable. Irreplaceable mortality due to parasitoids was greater in hollow stem wheat than in solid stem wheat. Host plant resistance due to stem solidness and parasitism in hollow stems cause substantial mortality in populations of actively feeding larvae responsible for all crop losses. Therefore, enhancing these mortality factors is vital to effective integrated pest management of wheat stem sawfly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cephus cinctus infestation causes $350 million in annual losses in the Northern Great Plains. We compared infestation and parasitism of C. cinctus in spring (including Kamut; Triticum turgidum ssp. turanicum) and winter wheat cultivars grown in organic and conventional fields in Montana, USA. In the greenhouse, we compared C. cinctus preference and survival in Kamut, Gunnison, and Reeder spring wheat cultivars. RESULTS: Stems cut by C. cinctus varied by farming system and the seasonality of the wheat crop. No stems of Kamut in organic fields were cut by C. cinctus, but 1.5% [±0.35% standard error (SE)] of stems in conventional spring wheat, 5% (±0.70% SE) of stems in organic winter wheat, and 20% (±0.93% SE) of stems in conventional winter wheat fields were cut by C. cinctus. More larvae of C. cinctus were parasitized in organic (27 ± 0.03% SE) compared with conventional (5 ± 0.01% SE) winter wheat fields. Cephus cinctus oviposition, survival, and the number of stems cut were lowest in Kamut compared with Gunnison and Reeder. CONCLUSION: Cephus cinctus infestation was more common in winter wheat than in spring wheat. Organic fields with fewer cut stems also supported more parasitoids. Kamut is a genetic resource for developing C. cinctus-resistant cultivars. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {Several species of wheat stem sawflies (WSS) are pests of wheat, including Cephus cinctus Norton in North America. Larvae feed inside the stems and cut the stem near plant maturity. The primary means of control is resistance due to solid stems, largely controlled by a locus on chromosome 3B (Qss.msub-3BL). Cultivars that differed for WSS resistance, but with similar stem solidness, were crossed to determine the genetic basis for the differences. The cultivar 'Scholar' is susceptible, while 'Conan' shows resistance. Scholar and Conan possessed different alleles at Qss.msub-3BL. Both alleles conferred solidness, yet the Conan allele conferred higher WSS resistance. An allele from Conan on chromosome 4A also decreased infestation and stem cutting. The 3B and 4A alleles from Conan acted in an additive fashion to provide increased WSS resistance without increasing stem solidness. Stem solidness has long been used by breeders as a proxy for WSS resistance because of its simplicity. Our results suggest that other resistance mechanisms may complement solid stems. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

Cumulative grain-yield losses and annual economic losses associated with this pest can exceed 30% and350 million, respectively. Solid-stemmed cultivars of common wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae), tolerant of infestation, are critical for C. cinctus management, but outbreaks of this pest continue to occur even after six decades of cultivar development. Furthermore, chemical control (a primary control option for other cereal (Poaceae) insect pests) has proven ineffective; this underscores the need to integrate resistant cultivars into a comprehensive integrated pest management program.

However, final reproductive output was not significantly different between ears on infested stems that supported complete larval development compared with ears on uninfested stems. 3: Stems containing parasitized larvae and stems containing larvae that died before completing their development had a higher mean number of seeds and seed weight, when accounting for number of fertile spikelets of each ear, than either infested with live larvae and uninfested stems. 4: The results obtained suggest that larval feeding prevented infested stems from attaining their yield potential, and that the negative impact of the pest on wheat yield was reduced when late instar sawfly larvae were parasitized. Even though some feeding occurs before parasitism, this early damage has a comparatively low impact on yield. 5: This is the first study to show a yield benefit and enhanced plant fitness due to the wheat stem sawfly parasitoids B. cephi and B. lissogaster.

A large body of work exists regarding smooth brome's biology and response to conservation management strategies designed to reduce its competitive effects on native prairie species, particularly for the tallgrass prairies of North America. Here we summarize that literature to improve restoration practice. In tallgrass prairie, smooth brome benefits from the early start of its growing season and its rhizomatous growth form, making it a strong competitor against native warm-season grasses. Late-spring burns timed to target smooth brome when root reserves are at their lowest have shown promise as a control strategy. Uncertainty remains, however, about the relative efficacy of fire, herbicide, mowing, or grazing to accomplish late-spring defoliation, the effect of repeated treatments, and the potential benefits of treatment combinations. The responses of resident or seeded natives to brome control treatments and/or the resulting decreases in brome cover also remain largely unexamined.

This study assessed oviposition preference in winter wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae), and investigated how it is affected by the emission of semiochemicals, with the overall goal of enhancing trap crop efficacy. We studied five winter wheat cultivars that could be recommended as trap crops for WSS and compared them with regards to agronomic characteristics influencing oviposition behavior and their emission of behaviorally active volatiles. Subsequently, we evaluated oviposition preference on three selected cultivars, 'Norstar', 'Neeley', and 'Rampart', using choice tests at two plant growth stages. Most eggs were found in Norstar at both stages tested when females were exposed to the three cultivars simultaneously making it the preferred choice for a trap crop. Norstar also emitted more behaviorally active volatiles, primarily (E)- and (Z)-β-ocimene. The results for the effect of main stem height or diameter on oviposition was inconsistent between infested vs. uninfested stems within cultivars, although there was a correlation between infestation and height for younger plants. These results show that these agronomic characteristics, typically viewed as explanatory, did not clearly explain oviposition preference and suggest a role of β-ocimene in determining suitability for oviposition among these cultivars. This study supports previous findings suggesting oviposition preference in winter wheat involves several cues, including stem height and volatile attractants that may be important in determining suitability. © 2012 The Authors.

Larvae of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), overwinter in post-harvest wheat stubble. Adults appear and disperse to new crops during the following growing season. Adults begin oviposition as soon as suitable hosts are encountered; therefore, larval infestations usually are concentrated along field borders. We tested several types of trap strips as intercepts to reduce dispersion of adult sawflies into fields. The most successful system was a fall-planted winter wheat trap that protected spring-planted wheat. These trap strips utilized the border effect as well as the higher attractiveness of the earlier maturing winter wheat.

   abstract = {Wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (WSS), is an important pest of cereal crops in Northern Great Plains. Smooth brome has historically been suggested as a potential trap crop around wheat fields in Montana. The objective of this study was to compare oviposition preference and selection behaviors of female WSS and measure subsequent larval survival in wheat and smooth brome stems. We compared infestation, parasitism and larval development of WSS using field transects in smooth brome and adjacent wheat fields. We found no clear difference in infestation between the two host plants. There was greater larval mortality and less tunneling in smooth brome stems compared to wheat at a site near Big Sandy, Montana. At a second site near Big Sandy, there was greater infestation in smooth brome compared to wheat, but there were more dead larvae and greater parasitism in smooth brome. In Y-tube olfactometer studies, WSS females were more attracted to volatiles emitted by smooth brome than wheat. In greenhouse trials, the observation of specific behaviors leading to oviposition indicated differences in duration of ovipositor insertion and in number of ovipositor insertions that favored greater oviposition in smooth brome, but only by emergence of the first awn of the inflorescence (Zadoks 49 growth stage). There were different numbers of eggs in smooth brome stems relative to wheat, with no difference in the proportion of infested stems in choice tests conducted for two days at Zadoks 49. In no-choice tests, there were differences in both infested stems and in the number of eggs in stems at Zadoks 49. We found significantly greater amounts of key behaviorally active compounds used by female WSS, like (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and β-ocimene, that were among the few differences in the amounts of volatile compounds collected from two plant species. The greater amount of these compounds leads to more eggs that subsequently experience greater larval mortality in young plants, resulting in fewer cut stems in mature plants. Our findings support the consideration of smooth brome for use in trap crops to improve integrated pest management strategies for WSS.},

The pest adapted to spring-planted wheat, Triticum aestivum L., within 10 yr after cultivation began. Fall-planted winter wheat originally avoided attack, but was consistently heavily damaged by 1985. We reviewed the factors affecting the recent adaptation of C. cinctus to winter wheat. No changes could be detected in the seasonal phenology of winter wheat. Decreased acreage of spring wheat from 1921 to 1945 reduced host availability. C. cinctus wasps are now emerging 20 d earlier than previously, and oviposition activity currently closely with susceptible growth stages of winter wheat. Larval cannibalism of eggs and younger larvae also provides natural selection for early season activity. Annual emergence of wasps from a population in wild grasses consistently begins later than in wheat.},

They also lowered the protein content in Thatcher by an average of 0.6% and a maximum of 1.2%. However, because a significant loss in protein content occurred in only 1 of 6 years in Red Bobs, the effects of the larvae on protein content cannot be generalized for all varieties. The losses in weight per head resulted from a mean reduction of 11.9% in the weight of the kernels combined with a mean reduction of 1.9 in the number of kernels per head. The larvae caused the losses by feeding in the stems and by cutting them when the moisture contents of the kernels were relatively high. Annual variations in losses were attributed to the dates of the infestation, to the amount of precipitation in July and August, and to differences in dates of cutting by the larvae. © 1977, Entomological Society of Canada.

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Norton [Hymenoptera: Cephidae]) is a serious threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cereal grains in the northern Great Plains. Insecticides have proven ineffective for sawfly control and can be detrimental to beneficial insects. The management of wheat stem sawfly, therefore, requires the integration of host plant resistance, agronomic and biological control strategies. Recent studies in Alberta, Canada have assessed the response of wheat stem sawfly and its natural enemies to cultivar selection, residue management, seeding rates, fertility regimes, and harvest management. Solid-stemmed cultivars are usually agronomically superior to susceptible cultivars when sawflies are present. The stubble disturbance associated with residue management and direct-seeding in a continuous cropping system can reduce sawfly populations compared to a wheat-fallow system. Increased seeding rates can optimize yield, but an inverse, negative relationship between pith expression (stem solidness) and higher seeding rates may occur. Positive yield responses are typically observed with N rates > 30 kg N ha-1 , but increased insect stem cutting by sawfly can occur with higher N rates. Increasing cutter bar heights during combine harvest can conserve natural enemies, and chopping straw for improved residue management in the spring will not likely affect wheat stem sawfly parasitoids that overwinter in the straw. In summary, an integrated strategy to manage wheat stem sawfly consists of diligent pest surveillance, planting solid-stemmed cultivars, continuous cropping with appropriate pre-seed residue management, seeding rates no greater than 300 seeds m-2 , 30 to 60 kg N ha-1 , and harvest cutting heights of at least 15 cm to conserve parasitoids.},

Oviposition preference and larval survival and development were determined for each of these varieties under laboratory and screen-house conditions. Two-choice tests revealed that seven of the varieties tested were preferentially chosen by gravid female moths for oviposition over a susceptible maize cv. Inbred A. Larval survival was significantly lower on the majority of the Napier grass varieties (about 10%) than on maize cv. Inbred A (about 60%). Similarly, larval development was about 2 weeks longer on the majority of the Napier grass varieties. It was concluded that four of the varieties tested (Bana, Ex-Machakos, Gold Coast, and Ex-Nyanza-2) had potential for use as trap crops in C. partellus management because they were more preferred by the borer moths for oviposition and allowed minimal survival of the larvae. This minimal larval survival is desirable in the conservation of C. partellus natural enemies when the cultivated host plant is out of season. © 2006 The Authors.},

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, causes severe losses in wheat grown in the northern Great Plains. Much of the affected area is planted in monoculture with wheat, Triticum aestivum L., grown in large fields alternating yearly between crop and no-till fallow. The crop and fallow fields are adjacent. This cropping landscape creates pronounced edge effects of sawfly infestations and may be amenable to trap cropping using existing agricultural practices. The behavioral preference for two wheat varieties was assessed in the context of developing trap crops for this insect. In field nurseries, stem lodging assessments indicated that the cultivar 'Conan' was infrequently damaged, whereas 'Reeder' was often heavily damaged. In laboratory choice and no-choice tests, 'Reeder' was significantly preferred by ovipositing wheat stem sawfly females. These two cultivars did not differ significantly in height or developmental stage, factors known to impact sawfly preference. Although Conan received fewer eggs than Reeder in no-choice tests, oviposition was further reduced in choice tests, indicating that females clearly preferred Reeder. In field trials where the overall dimensions of the spatial structure in choice tests was varied, females always selected Reeder over Conan in alternating block, row, and interseeded planting scenarios. Reeder releases greater amounts of the attractive compound, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate than Conan but is similar to Conan for three other known, behaviorally active volatile compounds. The results are discussed in terms of cultivar selection for large scale trap crop experiments for the wheat stem sawfly. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Species living in highly fragmented landscapes often occur as metapopulations with frequent population turnover. Turnover rate is known to depend on ecological factors, such as population size and connectivity, but it may also be influenced by the phenotypic and genotypic composition of populations. The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in Finland uses two host-plant species that vary in their relative abundances among distinct habitat patches (dry meadows) in a large network of ∼1,700 patches. We found no effect of host species use on local extinction. In contrast, population establishment was strongly influenced by the match between the host species composition of an empty habitat patch and the relative host use by larvae in previous years in the habitat patches that were well connected to the target patch. This colonization effect could be due to spatially variable plant acceptability or resistance or to spatially variable insect oviposition preference or larval performance. We show that spatial variation in adult oviposition preference occurs at the relevant spatial scale and that the other possible causes of the colonization effect can be discounted. We conclude that the colonization effect is generated by host preference influencing the movement patterns of ovipositing females. Migrant females with dissimilar host preferences have different perceptions of relative patch quality, which influences their likelihood of colonizing patches with particular host composition.},

   abstract = {The evolution of flowering plants has undoubtedly been influenced by a pollinator's ability to learn to associate floral signals with food. Here, we address the question of 'why' flowers produce scent by examining the ways in which olfactory learning by insect pollinators could influence how floral scent emission evolves in plant populations. 2. Being provided with a floral scent signal allows pollinators to learn to be specific in their foraging habits, which could, in turn, produce a selective advantage for plants if sexual reproduction is limited by the income of compatible gametes. Learning studies with honeybees predict that pollinator-mediated selection for floral scent production should favour signals which are distinctive and exhibit low variation within species because these signals are learned faster. Social bees quickly learn to associate scent with the presence of nectar, and their ability to do this is generally faster and more reliable than their ability to learn visual cues. 3. Pollinators rely on floral scent as a means of distinguishing honestly signalling flowers from deceptive ones. Furthermore, a pollinator's sensitivity to differences in nectar rewards can bias the way that it responds to floral scent. This mechanism may select for flowers that provide olfactory signals as an honest indicator of the presence of nectar or which select against the production of a detectable scent signal when no nectar is present. 4. We expect that an important yet commonly overlooked function of floral scent is an improvement in short-term pollinator specificity which provides an advantage to both pollinator and plant over the use of a visual signal alone. This, in turn, impacts the evolution of plant mating systems via its influence on the species-specific patterns of floral visitation by pollinators. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

We hypothesized that red leaf margins reduce leaf herbivory by signalling to herbivorous insects the presence of increased chemical defences. • Leaves were collected from a natural population of Pseudowintera colorata. Margin size, herbivory damage, anthocyanin content and concentrations of polygodial, a sesquiterpene dialdehyde with antifeedant properties, were quantified. Feeding trials involving larvae of Ctenopseustis obliquana, a generalist herbivore, were conducted on red- and green-margined P. colorata leaves in darkness, or under white, green or red light. • Leaves with wider red margins contained higher concentrations of polygodial and anthocyanins, and incurred less natural herbivory. In trials under white light, C. obliquana consumed disproportionately more green- than red-margined leaf laminae. Larvae exhibited no feeding preference when light was manipulated such that leaf colour discrimination was impaired. • Red leaf margins provide a reliable and effective visual signal of chemical defence in P. colorata. Ctenopseustis obliquana larvae perceive and respond to the colour of the leaf margins, rather than to olfactory signals.

Little research has been published regarding the noncultivated native and invasive grasses attacked by this insect. Knowledge of the complete host range of C. cinctus can inform future research about potential new sources of genetic resistance, improve understanding of the biology and spread of natural enemies, and better define this insect's role in grassland and agricultural systems. The aim of this review is to compile a checklist of reported host plants of C. cinctus and present data from an extensive survey of noncultivated hosts used by C. cinctus.},

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is a key pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America, and damage resulting from this species has recently expanded southward. Current pest management practices are inadequate and uncertainty regarding geographic origin, as well as limited data on population structure and dynamics across North America impede progress towards more informed management. We examined the genetic divergence between samples collected in North America and northeastern Asia, the assumed native range of C. cinctus using two mitochondrial regions (COI and 16S). Subsequently, we characterized the structure of genetic diversity in the main wheat producing areas in North America using a combination of mtDNA marker and microsatellites in samples collected both in wheat fields and in grasses in wildlands. The strong genetic divergence observed between North American samples and Asian congeners, in particular the synonimized C. hyalinatus, did not support the hypothesis of a recent American colonization by C. cinctus. Furthermore, the relatively high genetic diversity both with mtDNA and microsatellite markers offered additional evidence in favor of the native American origin of this pest. The genetic diversity of North American populations is structured into three genetic clusters and these are highly correlated with geography. Regarding the recent southern outbreaks in North America, the results tend to exclude the hypothesis of recent movement of damaging wheat stem sawfly populations from the northern area. The shift in host plant use by local populations appears to be the most likely scenario. Finally, the significance of these findings is discussed in the context of pest management.

   abstract = {For more than 100 yrs, the wheat stem sawfly (WSS) Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), has been a destructive pest of cereal crops in the Northern Great Plains. WSS infestation levels >70% have been reported, and economic loss from crop damage caused by this insect can be as high as $80 million (USD) per year in the state of Montana alone. Contact insecticides are not effective against WSS because the larvae and pupae are protected inside the plant stem, and the development of solid-stem cultivars have not resulted in sufficient declines in WSS populations. Biological control offers the best hope for achieving economical and sustainable management of WSS. However, development and advancement of WSS biological control strategies has been limited in recent years. Presently, there are three main types of biologicals available for managing WSS: two native hymenopteran parasitoids, entomopathogenic nematodes, and entomopathogenic fungi. Here, we present the most current research regarding the use of these biologicals against WSS, and we discuss new strategies and research opportunities for improving their effectiveness for managing this persistent pest. It is unlikely that a single agent will produce the desired results, but by increasing pressure from all three sources, their combined impact may more reliably cause significant reductions in WSS infestations. Eradication of WSS, a native species, is not a realistic goal, but it is probable that WSS populations will decline more readily as biological control methods continue to advance.},

   abstract = {Most barley cultivars have some degree of resistance to the wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae). Damage caused by WSS is currently observed in fields of barley grown in the Northern Great Plains, but the impact of WSS damage among cultivars due to genetic differences within the barley germplasm is not known. Specifically, little is known about the mechanisms underlying WSS resistance in barley. We characterized WSS resistance in a subset of the spring barley CAP (Coordinated Agricultural Project) germplasm panel containing 193 current and historically important breeding lines from six North American breeding programs. Panel lines were grown in WSS infested fields for two consecutive years. Lines were characterized for stem solidness, stem cutting, WSS infestation (antixenosis), larval mortality (antibiosis), and parasitism (indirect plant defense). Variation in resistance to WSS in barley was compared to observations made for solid-stemmed resistant and hollow-stemmed susceptible wheat lines. Results indicate that both antibiosis and antixenosis are involved in the resistance of barley to the WSS, but antibiosis seems to be more prevalent. Almost all of the barley lines had greater larval mortality than the hollow-stemmed wheat lines, and only a few barley lines had mortality as low as that observed in the solid-stemmed wheat line. Since barley lines lack solid stems, it is apparent that barley has a different form of antibiosis. Our results provide information for use of barley in rotation to control the WSS and may provide a basis for identification of new approaches for improving WSS resistance in wheat.},

   abstract = {Conservation biological control in agroecosystems requires a landscape management perspective, because most arthropod species experience their habitat at spatial scales beyond the plot level, and there is spillover of natural enemies across the crop-noncrop interface. The species pool in the surrounding landscape and the distance of crop from natural habitat are important for the conservation of enemy diversity and, in particular, the conservation of poorly-dispersing and specialized enemies. Hence, structurally complex landscapes with high habitat connectivity may enhance the probability of pest regulation. In contrast, generalist and highly vagile enemies may even profit from the high primary productivity of crops at a landscape scale and their abundance may partly compensate for losses in enemy diversity. Conservation biological control also needs a multitrophic perspective. For example, entomopathogenic fungi, plant pathogens and endophytes as well as below- and above-ground microorganisms are known to influence pest-enemy interactions in ways that vary across spatiotemporal scales. Enemy distribution in agricultural landscapes is determined by beta diversity among patches. The diversity needed for conservation biological control may occur where patch heterogeneity at larger spatial scales is high. However, enemy communities in managed systems are more similar across space and time than those in natural systems, emphasizing the importance of natural habitat for a spillover of diverse enemies. According to the insurance hypothesis, species richness can buffer against spatiotemporal disturbances, thereby insuring functioning in changing environments. Seemingly redundant enemy species may become important under global change. Complex landscapes characterized by highly connected crop-noncrop mosaics may be best for long-term conservation biological control and sustainable crop production, but experimental evidence for detailed recommendations to design the composition and configuration of agricultural landscapes that maintain a diversity of generalist and specialist natural enemies is still needed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), has been the most economically important insect pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains since cultivation began (Weiss and Morrill 1992). The wheat stem sawfly was first reported from wild grasses where populations were often highly parasitized by a number of parasitoids, including Bracon (= Microbracon) cephi (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (Criddle 1923; Ainslie 1929). A similar species, Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck, was later reported to also attack C. cinctus larvae (Muesebeck 1953; Somsen and Luginbill 1956). These parasitoids are now prevalent in wheat in some regions of Montana (Morrill et al. 1994, 1998; Morrill 1997). The life histories and phenologies of these sympatric idiobiont ectoparasitoids are similar. The ability to distinguish B. cephi from B. lissogaster is essential in elucidating their effects on populations of C. cinctus. We examined 159 females and 123 males of B. cephi from Chouteau, Hill, Stillwater, Teton, and Toole counties in Montana; Burke, Burleigh, Rolette, and Williams counties in North Dakota; Rock County in Minnesota; and southem Alberta (Rockyford and Consort).

Cropping systems developed during the early settlement years, summer fallowing and strip cropping, and drastic increases in wheat production led to wheat stem sawfly becoming a pest. The development and release of a solid-stemmed resistant cultivar, ‘Rescue’, in the 1940s and the subsequent release of improved cultivars have reduced losses significantly in regions heavily infested by the sawfly. The difference in yield potential of resistant cultivars compared with susceptible cultivars is less in the western range of the pest, and explanations are provided. Although resistant cultivars have reduced losses, the undesirable agronomic characteristics and lower yield potential have suppressed grower acceptance of the solid-stemmed cultivars. The lack of an accurate damage-prediction program forces growers to gamble between planting a susceptible cultivar and suffering yield loss because of the wheat stem sawfly or planting a resistant cultivar and suffering yield or quality reduction. Continued economic losses in spring wheat and recent infestations of winter wheat mandate continued research on this pest.},

   abstract = {Leaves normally release small quantities of volatile chemicals, but when a plant is damaged by herbivorous insects, many more volatiles are released. The chemical identity of the volatile compounds varies with the plant species and with the herbivorous insect species. These volatiles attract both parasitic and predatory insects that are natural enemies of the herbivores. They may also induce defense responses in neighboring plants. Such chemicals , which function in communication between and among species, as well as those that serve as messengers between members of the same species, are called semio-chemicals (from the Greek "semeion," a mark or signal) (Law and Regnier, 1971). Semiochemicals emitted from a diverse group of plants and insects mediate key processes in the behavior of specific insects. Volatile phytochemicals can serve as airborne semiochemicals, promoting or deterring interactions between plants and insect herbivores. For example, wheat seedlings without herbivore damage attract aphids, whereas odors released from wheat seedlings with a high density of aphids repel other aphids (Quiroz et al., 1997). For swallowtail butterflies, volatiles from host plants enhance the effect of contact stimulants, increasing landing rates and oviposition relative to non-host plants (Feeny et al., 1989). In addition to the bouquet of compounds that render leaves attractive or disagreeable to herbivores, volatile ter-penoids and other compounds emitted from leaves in response to insect damage allow insect parasitoids (such as parasitic wasps) and predators to distinguish between infested and noninfested plants, and thus aid in locating hosts or prey (Fig. 1). These phytodistress signals, which result in an active interaction between herbivore-damaged plants and a third trophic level, have been described for several agro-ecosystems. Examples include lima bean and apple plants, which produce volatiles that attract predatory mites when damaged by spider mites (Takabayashi and Dicke, 1996), and corn and cotton plants, which release volatiles that attract hymenopterous parasitoids that attack larvae of several Lepidoptera species (Tumlinson et al., 1993). In the latter case, a parasitoid female injects her eggs when she stings, and the eggs hatch into wasp larvae inside the caterpillar. Once the caterpillar has been stung, its reproductive cycle is terminated and a new generation of wasps is produced. In all plants reported thus far, there are notable similarities in the structure of the volatile compounds that are emitted from insect-damaged leaves and from leaves distal to the site of damage. The structural uniformity in the chemical emissions from different plants with insect feeding suggests the activation of a common set of biosynthetic pathways shared by a wide range of plant families, and that the products are detectable to a broad spectrum of insect parasitoids and predators (Fig. 2). The ability of host-seeking insects to recognize and respond to such chemical cues and differentiate them from background odors indicates that insect-damaged plants emit volatile chemicals that are clearly distinguishable from those released in response to other types of damage or those released from undamaged plants. The plant's ability to differentiate between herbivore damage and a general wound response suggests the presence of elicitors associated with insect feeding that are absent from other types of leaf damage. PLANTS RESPOND TO INSECT FEEDING DAMAGE BY RELEASING GREATER AMOUNTS OF A VARIETY OF VOLATILES An undamaged plant maintains a baseline level of volatile metabolites that are released from the surface of the leaf and/or from accumulated storage sites in the leaf. These constitutive chemical reserves, which often include mono-terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and aromatics, accumulate to high levels in specialized glands or trichomes (Paré and Tumlinson, 1997a). In addition, green-leaf odors consisting of a blend of saturated and unsaturated six-carbon alcohols , aldehydes, and esters are produced by autolytic oxi-dative breakdown of membrane lipids and are released when leaves are mechanically damaged. This pattern of constitutive compounds has been analyzed in the field for perennials, including beech (Tollsten and Mü ller, 1996) and ash (Markovic et al., 1996) trees, as well as under greenhouse conditions for many herbaceous annuals, including},

   abstract = {Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster are native parasitoids of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus, an important pest of dryland wheat production. This spatial distribution study, using survey data from seven dryland wheat fields at four locations in north-central Montana over two years, examined: (1) the spatial distribution and spatial association of C. cinctus infestation and parasitism, and (2) parasitism in response to the level of C. cinctus infestation. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that C. cinctus infestations were significantly aggregated along field edges in three of five fields, while parasitism followed a random spatial distribution in all five fields. We demonstrate that the level of parasitism is highest for lower levels of C. cinctus infestation, in fields where parasitoids are either scarce or abundant. The combination of (1) a spatial aggregation of C. cinctus infestations along field edges, and (2) a potential negative interaction between parasitism and C. cinctus infestation may lower the level of parasitism at high host densities. This outcome can be viewed as beneficial to the insect pest, because parasitized C. cinctus larvae are at a greater risk of being cannibalized by conspecifics. An equally plausible hypothesis for this negative interaction is a limitation on the successful location of unparasitized hosts at higher host densities, which is also compelling because of the cryptic location of hosts within wheat stems that belie little visible evidence of infestation. Supporting data from other heavily infested fields that were sampled in 1999-2000 are used to illustrate the recurrence of this pattern. These findings are discussed in the context of developing redistribution strategies for introducing these parasitoids at sawfly infested locations where they are currently present at negligible levels. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Originally a grass feeder, it is becoming a serious menace to the grain growers of the Northwestern States because of its acquired appetite for small grains, within the stems of which it now subsists. Such changes of diet are probably occurring everywhere with greater frequency than formerly was deemed possible, especially among the phytophagous insects of the Middle West .

Early reports of plants escaped from cultivation appear in 1903, and based on the number of collec- tions prior to 1920, smooth brome spread most rapidly in western Canada. It is common along roadsides, forest margins, clear- ings, shorelines and disturbed areas, but its most detrimental impact is on the diversity of prairies and native grasslands. For example, in Riding Mountain National Park, MB, plant diversity of fescue prairies recently invaded by smooth brome decreased by 70%. Vegetative proliferation through underground rhizomes is key to the invasiveness of smooth brome, but long-range dis- persal of seeds is facilitated by animals, wind and the transport of hay. Smooth brome is effectively controlled using selective applications of glyphosate and well-timed clipping. However, restoration of infested areas depends on the composition of native seed banks. Smooth brome remains valuable as a forage and cover crop in every province and territory in Canada. Key},

   abstract = {The ability of alien plant species to invade a region depends not only on attributes of the plant, but on characteristics of the habitat being invaded. Here, we examine characteristics that may influence the success of alien plant invasion in mixed-grass prairie at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in western North Dakota, USA. The park consists of two geographically separate units with similar vegetation types and management history, which allowed us to examine the effects of native vegetation type, anthropogenic disturbance , and the separate park units on the invasion of native plant communities by alien plant species common to counties surrounding both park units. If matters of chance related to availability of propagules and transient establishment opportunities determine the success of invasion, park unit and anthropogenic disturbance should better explain the variation in alien plant frequency. If invasibility is more strongly related to biotic or physical characteristics of the native plant communities, models of alien plant occurrence should include vegetation type as an explanatory variable. We examined 1300 transects across all vegetation types in both units of the park. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) indicated that the fully parameterized model, including the interaction among vegetation type, disturbance, and park unit, best described the distribution of both total number of alien plants per transect and frequency of alien plants on transects where they occurred. Although all vegetation types were invaded by alien plants, mesic communities had both greater numbers and higher frequencies of alien plants than did drier communities. A strong element of stochasticity, reflected in differences in frequencies of individual species between the two park units, suggests that prediction of risk of invasion will always involve uncertainty. In addition, despite well-documented associations between anthropogenic disturbance and alien plant invasion, five of the six most abundant alien species at Theodore Roosevelt National Park had distributions unrelated to disturbance. We recommend that vegetation type be explicitly taken into account when designing monitoring plans for alien species in natural areas.},

   abstract = {The effects of invasive species on the patch dynamics (establishment, growth, and local extinction) of native species are not well studied, owing to the need for relatively fine-scale data on the distribution of species. Within the prairie pothole region of the United States and Canada, the grass, Bromus inermis (smooth brome) has become established by invading disturbed prairies, and through repeated introductions for soil retention and animal graze. In this study, the impact of smooth brome on the patch dynamics of a dominant native grass species, Spartina pectinata (prairie cordgrass), was assessed using fine-scale (sub-meter) mapping of the distribution of cordgrass and brome in three prairie fragments from 2000 to 2006. Using GIS spatial analyses, we determined that cordgrass patch growth was two times greater in areas not invaded by smooth brome versus areas that were heavily infested with smooth brome. Among sites and time periods, there was a consistent significant negative relationship between the amount of smooth brome surrounding a patch of cordgrass and the growth of that cordgrass patch. The probability of establishment of a new patch of cordgrass averaged 1.3 times higher in areas of low brome coverage (<25%) than areas of high brome coverage (>75%). Conversely, existing cordgrass patches were 7.8 times more likely to go extinct in areas of high than low brome coverage. This is one of only a few field studies to provide evidence of the negative impact of smooth brome on native flora and hopefully will serve as justification for the development of a formal management plan to limit the distribution of this species in tallgrass prairie ecosystems.},

Schneider (1957) pioneered the electroantennogram (EAG) technique and carried out the first electrophysiological experiments on olfaction in insects with Bombyx mori. Studies with B. mori revealed that slow olfactory receptor potentials could be recorded from an isolated antenna positioned between two glass capillary microelectrodes connected to an amplifier and a recording instrument. Schneider (1963) suggested that the ``EAG is essentially the sum of many olfactory receptor potentials recorded more or less simultaneously by an electrode located in the sensory epithelium.'' He interpreted (Schneider, 1969) the negative potential of these slow electrical reactions of dendrites in the olfactory cells as a receptor membrane depolarization. The amplitude of the response, which correlates to the frequency of generated nerve impulses, was found to increase with increasing concentrations of the chemical stimulus until a saturation level was reached.},

   abstract = {Electroantennogram responses of Colorado beetles were recorded to 53 plant volatiles including isomers. The system of antennal olfactory receptors is selective, even at high doses several compounds cause fairly small responses. Diminishing the concentration to a moderate stimulus strength reduces the number of perceptible chemicals. Distinct electroantennogram responses are obtained to a group of closely related components, namely the general green leaf volatiles trans‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol, cis‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol, hexanol‐1, trans‐2‐hexenal, hexanal and cis‐3‐hexenyl‐acetate, and to isomers such as trans‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol and cis‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol. The threshold concentration of the most effective compound, trans‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol is 1.2 × 108 molecules per ml of air. The antennal olfactory receptors of the Colorado beetle are sensitively tuned to the perception of these general green leaf volatiles. As olfactory receptors of a number of phytophagous insects have been reported to respond to these components, this volatile complex probably plays a part in the host selection behaviour of various phytophagous insects.

Le système des récepteurs olfactifs antennaires est sélectif, même à des doses élevées plusieurs composés ne provoquent que d'assez faibles réponses. La diminution de la concentration jusqu'à une puissance stimulante modérée réduit le nombre de substances perçues. Des électroantennogrammes différents ont été obtenus pour un groupe de composés très voisins, à savoir les substances volatiles de feuilles vertes: trans‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol, cis‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol, hexanol‐1, trans‐2‐hexenal et cis‐3‐hexenyl‐acetate, et aux isomères tels que trans‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol et cis‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol. La concentration seuil du composé le plus efficace, trans‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol, est de 1,2 × 108 molécules par ml d'air. Les récepteurs olfactifs antennaires du Doryphore sont sensoriellement ajustés à la perception de ces substances volatiles générales des feuilles vertes. Comme les récepteurs olfactifs de nombreux insectes phytophages ont été signalés comme répondant à ces composés, ce complexe volatile joue probablement un rôle dans le comportement de sélection de l'hôte par différents insectes phytophages. 1979 The Netherlands Entomological Society},

   abstract = {It is well accepted that agricultural production must be increased considerably in the foreseeable future to meet the food and feed demands of a rising human population and increasing livestock production. Crop protection plays a key role in safeguarding crop productivity against competition from weeds, animal pests, pathogens and viruses. The loss potential of these pest groups and the actual losses - i.e. losses despite the present crop protection practices - have been estimated for wheat, rice, maize, barley, potatoes, soybeans, sugar beet and cotton for the period 1996-1998 on a regional basis for 17 regions. Among crops the loss potential of pests worldwide varied from less than 50% (on barley) to more than 80% (on sugar beet and cotton). Actual losses are estimated at 26-30% for sugar beet, barley, soybean, wheat and cotton, and 35%, 39% and 40% for maize, potatoes and rice, respectively. Overall, weeds had the highest loss potential (32%) with animal pests and pathogens being less important (18% and 15%, respectively). Although viruses cause serious problems in potatoes and sugar beets in some areas, worldwide losses due to viruses averaged 6-7% on these crops and <1-3% in other crops. The efficacy of crop protection was highest in cash crops (53-68%) and lower (43-50%) in food crops. The variation coefficient of efficacy among regions was low in cash crops (12-18%) and highest in wheat (28%). As weed control can be achieved through mechanical or chemical means, worldwide efficacy in weed control (68%) was considerably higher than the control of animal pests or diseases (39% and 32%, respectively), which relies heavily on pesticides. The intensification of crop production necessary to meet the increasing demand through enhanced productivity per unit area might be impossible without a concomitant intensification of pest control. The perspectives of integrated pest management in safeguarding crop production and preventing negative effects on the environment are discussed for developing and developed countries. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Since its commercial introduction in 1974, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] has become the dominant herbicide worldwide. There are several reasons for its success. Glyphosate is a highly effective broadspectrum herbicide, yet it is very toxicologically and environmentally safe. Glyphosate translocates well, and its action is slow enough to take advantage of this. Glyphosate is the only herbicide that targets 5-enolpyruvylshikimate- 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), so there are no competing herbicide analogs or classes. Since glyphosate became a generic compound, its cost has dropped dramatically. Perhaps the most important aspect of the success of glyphosate has been the introduction of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops in 1996. Almost 90% of all transgenic crops grown worldwide are glyphosate resistant, and the adoption of these crops is increasing at a steady pace. Glyphosate/glyphosate-resistant crop weed management offers significant environmental and other benefits over the technologies that it replaces. The use of this virtually ideal herbicide is now being threatened by the evolution of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Adoption of resistance management practices will be required to maintain the benefits of glyphosate technologies for future generations.},

   abstract = {Drivers behind food security and crop protection issues are discussed in relation to food losses caused by pests. Pests globally consume food estimated to feed an additional one billion people. Key drivers include rapid human population increase, climate change, loss of beneficial on-farm biodiversity, reduction in per capita cropped land, water shortages, and EU pesticide withdrawals under policies relating to 91/414 EEC. IPM (Integrated Pest Management) will be compulsory for all EU agriculture by 2014 and is also being widely adopted globally. IPM offers a 'toolbox' of complementary crop-and region-specific crop protection solutions to address these rising pressures. IPM aims for more sustainable solutions by using complementary technologies. The applied research challenge now is to reduce selection pressure on single solution strategies, by creating additive/synergistic interactions between IPM components. IPM is compatible with organic, conventional, and GM cropping systems and is flexible, allowing regional fine-tuning. It reduces pests below economic thresholds utilizing key 'ecological services', particularly biocontrol. A recent global review demonstrates that IPM can reduce pesticide use and increase yields of most of the major crops studied. Landscape scale 'ecological engineering', together with genetic improvement of new crop varieties, will enhance the durability of pest-resistant cultivars (conventional and GM). IPM will also promote compatibility with semiochemicals, biopesticides, precision pest monitoring tools, and rapid diagnostics. These combined strategies are urgently needed and are best achieved via multi-disciplinary research, including complex spatio-temporal modelling at farm and landscape scales. Integrative and synergistic use of existing and new IPM technologies will help meet future food production needs more sustainably in developed and developing countries, in an era of reduced pesticide availability. Current IPM research gaps are identified and discussed. © 2011 The Author(s).},

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

   abstract = {Recent reports of dramatic declines in insect abundance suggest grave consequences for global ecosystems and human society. Most evidence comes from Europe, however, leaving uncertainty about insect population trends worldwide. We used '5,300 time series for insects and other arthropods, collected over 4–36 years at monitoring sites representing 68 different natural and managed areas, to search for evidence of declines across the United States. Some taxa and sites showed decreases in abundance and diversity while others increased or were unchanged, yielding net abundance and biodiversity trends generally indistinguishable from zero. This lack of overall increase or decline was consistent across arthropod feeding groups and was similar for heavily disturbed versus relatively natural sites. The apparent robustness of US arthropod populations is reassuring. Yet, this result does not diminish the need for continued monitoring and could mask subtler changes in species composition that nonetheless endanger insect-provided ecosystem services.},

   abstract = {Recent reports of local extinctions of arthropod species1, and of massive declines in arthropod biomass2, point to land-use intensification as a major driver of decreasing biodiversity. However, to our knowledge, there are no multisite time series of arthropod occurrences across gradients of land-use intensity with which to confirm causal relationships. Moreover, it remains unclear which land-use types and arthropod groups are affected, and whether the observed declines in biomass and diversity are linked to one another. Here we analyse data from more than 1 million individual arthropods (about 2,700 species), from standardized inventories taken between 2008 and 2017 at 150 grassland and 140 forest sites in 3 regions of Germany. Overall gamma diversity in grasslands and forests decreased over time, indicating loss of species across sites and regions. In annually sampled grasslands, biomass, abundance and number of species declined by 67%, 78% and 34%, respectively. The decline was consistent across trophic levels and mainly affected rare species; its magnitude was independent of local land-use intensity. However, sites embedded in landscapes with a higher cover of agricultural land showed a stronger temporal decline. In 30 forest sites with annual inventories, biomass and species number—but not abundance—decreased by 41% and 36%, respectively. This was supported by analyses of all forest sites sampled in three-year intervals. The decline affected rare and abundant species, and trends differed across trophic levels. Our results show that there are widespread declines in arthropod biomass, abundance and the number of species across trophic levels. Arthropod declines in forests demonstrate that loss is not restricted to open habitats. Our results suggest that major drivers of arthropod decline act at larger spatial scales, and are (at least for grasslands) associated with agriculture at the landscape level. This implies that policies need to address the landscape scale to mitigate the negative effects of land-use practices.},

Here, we consider how insects are responding to recent climate change while summarizing the literature on long-term monitoring of insect populations in the context of climatic fluctuations. Results to date suggest that climate change impacts on insects have the potential to be considerable, even when compared with changes in land use. The importance of climate is illustrated with a case study from the butterflies of Northern California, where we find that population declines have been severe in high-elevation areas removed from the most immediate effects of habitat loss. These results shed light on the complexity of montane-adapted insects responding to changing abiotic conditions. We also consider methodological issues that would improve syntheses of results across long-term insect datasets and highlight directions for future empirical work.},

Orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) are critical long-distance pollinators and may be highly susceptible to forest fragmentation given their reliance on forest habitat. Previous studies on the impact of forest fragmentation on euglossines have been geographically limited, have largely ignored β-diversity, and have not compared fragments with continuous forest. To contribute to addressing these gaps, we sampled male euglossine bees in 18 forest fragments (area range: 2.5–33 ha) and at eight locations within a large (3500 ha) continuous forest in the Chocó biodiversity hotspot of Ecuador during the dry season in 2014. We assessed how euglossine abundance, richness, and evenness related to fragment area, isolation, and edge:area ratio. We also compared fragments to continuous forest, in terms of α- and β-diversity. In fragments, a single species (Euglossa tridentata) comprised 78% of captures, and we found no significant effect of fragment area, isolation, or edge on abundance, richness, or evenness among fragments. Forest fragments and continuous forest differed in both community composition and evenness, but not in abundance or species richness. Spatial turnover (β-diversity) showed a non-significant trend toward changing more rapidly in continuous forest relative to fragments. These results underscore the conservation value of continuous forest for orchid bee diversity.},

   abstract = {Declines in the abundance and diversity of insects pose a substantial threat to terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Yet, identifying the causes of these declines has proved difficult, even for well-studied species like monarch butterflies, whose eastern North American population has decreased markedly over the last three decades. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the changes observed in the eastern monarch population: loss of milkweed host plants from increased herbicide use, mortality during autumn migration and/or early-winter resettlement and changes in breeding-season climate. Here, we use a hierarchical modelling approach, combining data from >18,000 systematic surveys to evaluate support for each of these hypotheses over a 25-yr period. Between 2004 and 2018, breeding-season weather was nearly seven times more important than other factors in explaining variation in summer population size, which was positively associated with the size of the subsequent overwintering population. Although data limitations prevent definitive evaluation of the factors governing population size between 1994 and 2003 (the period of the steepest monarch decline coinciding with a widespread increase in herbicide use), breeding-season weather was similarly identified as an important driver of monarch population size. If observed changes in spring and summer climate continue, portions of the current breeding range may become inhospitable for monarchs. Our results highlight the increasingly important contribution of a changing climate to insect declines.},

ALAN may be contributing to widely reported declines in insect populations but supporting evidence is sparse. Recent advances in external lighting technology, particularly the increasing adoption of broad spectrum ‘white’ LEDs, suggest that impacts of ALAN on natural systems are likely to increase. This special issue of Insect Conservation and Diversity presents some of the recent research addressing the impacts of ALAN on insects and their conservation. The papers cover (i) reviews of existing literature, (ii) results from experimental studies of impacts of ALAN on insects, from individual species to communities, (iii) priorities for future research, and (iv) best practice recommendations for designing future experimentation. Collectively, the papers illustrate a vibrant and expanding field of enquiry. In addition to further studies of effects at the individual insect level, future research priorities will need to address how ALAN affects long-term population dynamics, the composition of insect communities and ecosystem services. A major challenge will be to devise novel ways to minimise the adverse effects of ALAN which can be used to inform conservation interventions. Various mitigation strategies are available, including modification of the spectral composition of lighting, dimming, shielding and controlling illumination using timers and motion sensors, but require customisation for particular species and situations.},

However, most of the evidence on which these claims are made is patchy, based on studies with low taxonomic and geographic representativeness. Here, we model the effect of land-use type and intensity on global pollinator biodiversity, using a local-scale database covering 303 studies, 12,170 sites, and 4502 pollinating species. Relative to a primary vegetation baseline, we show that low levels of intensity can have beneficial effects on pollinator biodiversity. Within most anthropogenic land-use types however, increasing intensity is associated with significant reductions, particularly in urban (43% richness and 62% abundance reduction compared to the least intensive urban sites), and pasture (75% abundance reduction) areas. We further show that on cropland, the strongly negative response to intensity is restricted to tropical areas, and that the direction and magnitude of response differs among taxonomic groups. Our findings confirm widespread effects of land-use intensity on pollinators, most significantly in the tropics, where land use is predicted to change rapidly.},

City sites have lower insect species richness, particularly of Diptera and Lepidoptera, than neighbouring rural sites. In contrast, Hymenoptera, especially bees, show higher species richness and flower visitation rates in cities, where our experimentally derived measure of pollination is correspondingly higher. As well as revealing facets of biodiversity (e.g. phylogenetic diversity) that correlate well with pollination, we also find that ecotones in insect-friendly green cover surrounding both urban and rural sites boost pollination. Appropriately managed cities could enhance the conservation of Hymenoptera and thereby act as hotspots for pollination services that bees provide to wild flowers and crops grown in urban settings.},

   abstract = {Major declines in insect biomass and diversity, reviewed here, have become obvious and well documented since the end of World War II. Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11% of the world's land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields. Some of the insects that we are destroying, including pollinators and predators of crop pests, are directly beneficial to the crops. In the tropics generally, natural vegetation is being destroyed rapidly and often replaced with export crops such as oil palm and soybeans. To mitigate the effects of the Sixth Mass Extinction event that we have caused and are experiencing now, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live, will be necessary.},

Wild bees are central to pollination and documenting unique regional interactions between wild bees and floral hosts provides powerful insights into local ecology and biodiversity in addition to the potential to detect temporal network variation. This study characterises the changes in a northern New England wild bee plant-pollinator network over the past 125 years and reveals a striking increase in exotic bee and plant taxa over time. Here we document that declining wild bee species have historic ties to threatened and endangered plant species. These data provide a rare insight into the fragile nature of plant-pollinator networks. Notable specialist interactions between native taxa that were recorded in historical networks have been lost, most likely due to local extirpation of these now threatened and endangered plant species. Subsequent monitoring and conservation efforts focused on habitat restoration for declining wild bee and plant taxa are fundamental to the future preservation of regional native diversity.},

One management strategy gaining much attention is the use of wildflower strips planted alongside crops to provide supplemental floral resources for pollinators. However, farmer adoption of pollinator-friendly strategies has been minimal, likely due to uncertainty about costs and benefits of providing non-crop flowering plants for bees. Over 3 yr, on four diversified farms in Montana, United States, we estimated the potential economic profit of harvesting and selling wildflower seeds collected from flower strips implemented for wild bee conservation, as an incentive for farmers to adopt this management practice. We compared the potential profitability of selling small retail seed packets versus bulk wholesale seed. Our economic analyses indicated that potential revenue from retail seed sales exceeded the costs associated with establishing and maintaining wildflower strips after the second growing season. A wholesale approach, in contrast, resulted in considerable net economic losses. We provide proof-of-concept that, under retail scenarios, the sale of native wildflower seeds may provide an alternative economic benefit that, to our knowledge, remains unexplored. The retail seed-sales approach could encourage greater farmer adoption of wildflower strips as a pollinator-conservation strategy in agroecosystems. The approach could also fill a need for regionally produced, native wildflower seed for habitat restoration and landscaping aimed at conserving native plants and pollinators.},

This is especially urgent in threatened areas that concentrate high biodiversity such as the Atlantic forest (AF) in South America. Orchid bees are among the most important pollinators in the AF and are considered as good biological indicators of environmental quality. However, the populations of these bees have been reduced in size as a result of environmental impacts caused by human activities. In the present study, we used historical climate modelling to infer the refuge areas within the AF that concentrate high genetic diversity of orchid bees. From a total of 235 records of ten species, we built species models for the current days, Mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum periods using MaxEnt program. Our results show refuge areas separately for each species, which may harbor their high levels of individual genetic diversity in the AF. On the other hand, the assemblage-scale model of climate stability shows a large continuous range of suitable areas from the southern to the northern AF, divided into three main stability zones (northeastern, central and southeastern-southern) where putatively are concentrated high levels of genetic diversity for most of these bees. This inference of stability zones should be useful to direct the choice of new conservation units in the AF, mainly in the northern portion of the AF, where the zone of greater suitability for orchid bees analyzed is present, which has been under protected and has experienced an increase of deforestation in the recent years. Finally, we point out that phylogeographic studies with these bees are necessary and might validate our findings.},

   abstract = {Moths are the most taxonomically and ecologically diverse insect taxon for which there exist considerable time-series abundance data. There is an alarming record of decreases in moth abundance and diversity from across Europe, with rates varying markedly among and within regions. Recent reports from Costa Rica reveal steep cross-lineage declines of caterpillars, while other sites (Ecuador and Arizona, reported here) show no or only modest long-term decreases over the past two decades. Rates of decline for dietary and ecological specialists are steeper than those for ecologically generalized taxa. Additional traits commonly associated with elevated risks include large wingspans, small geographic ranges, low dispersal ability, and univoltinism; taxa associated with grasslands, aridlands, and nutrient-poor habitats also appear to be at higher risk. In temperate areas, many moth taxa limited historically by abiotic factors are increasing in abundance and range. We regard the most important continental-scale stressors to include reductions in habitat quality and quantity resulting from land-use change and climate change and, to a lesser extent, atmospheric nitrification and introduced species. Site-specific stressors include pesticide use and light pollution. Our assessment of global macrolepidopteran population trends includes numerous cases of both region-wide and local losses and studies that report no declines. Spatial variation of reported losses suggests that multiple stressors are in play. With the exception of recent reports from Costa Rica, the most severe examples of moth declines are from Northern Hemisphere regions of high human-population density and intensive agriculture.},

Fragmentary observations, however, have suggested population declines in several North American species. Despite rising concern over these observations in the United States, highlighted in a recent National Academy of Sciences report, a national assessment of the geographic scope and possible causal factors of bumble bee decline is lacking. Here, we report results of a 3-y interdisciplinary study of changing distributions, population genetic structure, and levels of pathogen infection in bumble bee populations across the United States. We compare current and historical distributions of eight species, compiling a database of >73,000 museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of >16,000 specimens. We show that the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to 96% and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by 23-87%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian pathogen Nosemabombi and lower genetic diversity compared with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species. Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus, realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.},

   abstract = {It has been suggested that we do not know within an order of magnitude the number of all species on Earth [May RM (1988) Science 241(4872):1441-1449]. Roughly 1.5 million valid species of all organisms have been named and described [Costello MJ, Wilson S, Houlding B (2012) Syst Biol 61(5):871-883]. Given Kingdom Animalia numerically dominates this list and virtually all terrestrial vertebrates have been described, the question of how many terrestrial species exist is all but reduced to one of how many arthropod species there are. With beetles alone accounting for about 40% of all described arthropod species, the truly pertinent question is how many beetle species exist. Here we present four new and independent estimates of beetle species richness, which produce a mean estimate of 1.5 million beetle species. We argue that the surprisingly narrow range (0.9-2.1 million) of these four autonomous estimates - derived from host-specificity relationships, ratios with other taxa, plant:beetle ratios, and a completely novel body-size approach - represents a major advance in honing in on the richness of this most significant taxon, and is thus of considerable importance to the debate on how many species exist. Using analogous approaches, we also produce independent estimates for all insects, mean: 5.5 million species (range 2.6-7.8 million), and for terrestrial arthropods, mean: 6.8 million species (range 5.9-7.8 million), which suggest that estimates for the world's insects and their relatives are narrowing considerably.},

   abstract = {The impact of larval feeding by wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), and reduced water availability on the photosynthesis and primary metabolism of wheat, Triticum aestivum (L), was evaluated at the grain-filling developmental stage. Photosynthetic parameters measured included photosynthesis (Ps), stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration (E) in the flag leaves. The parameters were measured at 4 wks after the treatments were imposed. Additional concomitant chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements were taken using both dark- and light-adapted tests. Photosynthesis was significantly affected by C. cinctus injury and suboptimal water availability. However, no significant interaction was observed between the two treatment factors. Plants under a reduced or suboptimal watering regime had Ps rates that were 43.7% lower than plants that were watered daily. We also observed a 12% higher Ps rate in uninfested plants compared to plants infested by C. cinctus. Several chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters also were affected by C. cinctus. Specifically, reductions in the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of C. cinctus infested plants were observed for plants under reduced water availability. This study demonstrates that wheat plants at the grain filling stage have reduced photosynthetic capacity when watered less frequently or when subjected to C. cinctus larval feeding injury. Less frequent watering and larval feeding injury did not have significant impacts on yield in this greenhouse study.},

   abstract = {I describe an artificial patch system that was used to study the foraging behavior of free-roaming downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens) in a woodlot in southeastern Michigan. The artificial "patches" used were thin logs into which were drilled small holes to hold food items (bits of sunflower seed kernels). Downy woodpeckers would systematically search the holes of a patch for food items and thus by manipulating the food distribution within the patches, the birds could be made to experience differing rates of energy intake while foraging. Simple deterministic theories of optimal foraging in patchy environments indicate that an optimal forager, who experiences a decreasing rate of energy intake while foraging in a patch, should leave a patch when its rate of energy intake falls below the average intake rate for the overall environment. In other words, an optimal forager is continually assessing the quality of a patch and makes decisions as to when to leave a patch via its energy intake rate. When the downy woodpeckers studied could encounter any one of several types of patches each with differing, decreasing rates of energy intake, they followed a patch quality assessment strategy similar to that suggested by theory. Upon encountering a single type of patch for a number of consecutive days, however, the birds appeared to forage according to prior expectations of patch quality and not according to a quality assessment strategy based on energy intake rates. The observed expectations were not related to the number of food items per patch but they appeared to be based on expectations of when or where to leave a patch. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.},

However, the impacts of global change on the stability of biodiversity have not been systematically studied in terms of both large spatial (continental drift) and temporal (from the last inter-glacial period to the next century) scales. Therefore, we analyzed the current geographical distribution pattern of Plecoptera, a thermally sensitive insect group, and evaluated its stability when coping with global change across both space and time throughout the Mediterranean region—one of the first 25 global biodiversity hotspots. Regional biodiversity of Plecoptera reflected the geography in both the historical movements of continents and the current environmental conditions in the western Mediterranean region. The similarity of Plecoptera assemblages between areas in this region indicated that the uplift of new land and continental drift were the primary determinants of the stability of regional biodiversity. Our results revealed that climate change caused the biodiversity of Plecoptera to slowly diminish in the past and will cause remarkably accelerated biodiversity loss in the future. These findings support the theory that climate change has had its greatest impact on biodiversity over a long temporal scale.},

However, in the 1980s, it was found infesting winter wheat fields in Montana. Infestations were first detected in western Nebraska in the 1990s, and have since spread throughout the Nebraska Panhandle. Larval damage occurs from stem-mining, but stem girdling that results in lodged stems that are not harvested results in the greatest yield losses. The biology and phenology of the wheat stem sawfly are well described in the northern portion of its range, but they are lacking in Colorado, southeast Wyoming, and Nebraska. In this study, the phenology and dispersal of the wheat stem sawfly in Nebraska winter wheat fields is described using sweep net and larval sampling. During this 2-yr study, adult activity began on May 23 and ended on June 21. Adult sex ratios were 2.32 males per female in 2014 and 0.46 males per female in 2015. Both sexes demonstrated an edge effect within the wheat fields, with greater densities near the field edge. The edge effect was stronger for male wheat stem sawfly than females. Wheat stem sawfly larval density also had an edge effect, regardless of the density of female wheat stem sawfly present. This information will be useful for developing management plans for the wheat stem sawfly in Nebraska and neighboring regions.},

Differences observed in gene expression in the endosperm between conventionally bred material were much larger in comparison to differences between transgenic and untransformed lines exhibiting the same complements of gluten subunits. These results suggest that the presence of the transgenes did not significantly alter gene expression and that, at this level of investigation, transgenic plants could be considered substantially equivalent to untransformed parental lines. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Genetically engineered (GE) crops that provide protection against insects and diseases, or tolerance to herbicides are important tools that complement a diversified integrated pest management (IPM) plan. However, despite the advantages that GE crops may bring for simplifying the approach and improving efficiency of pest and weed control, there are also challenges for successful implementation and sustainable use. This paper considers how several GE traits, including those that confer protection against insects by expression of proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), traits that confer tolerance to herbicides, and RNAi-based traits that confer resistance to viral pathogens, can be key elements of a diversified IPM plan for several different crops in both developed and developing countries. Additionally, we highlight the importance of community engagement and extension, strong partnership between industry, regulators and farmers, and education and training programs, for achieving long-term success. By leveraging the experiences gained with these GE crops, understanding the limitations of the technology, and considering the successes and failures of GE traits in IPM plans for different crops and regions, we can improve the sustainability and versatility of IPM plans that incorporate these and future technologies.},

The size of alfalfa roots within a particular area vary for various reasons, and, since the amount of larval feeding may vary with root size, the biased procedure of sampling two alfalfa roots from each plot was used in an attempt to eliminate this variation. If the results from the two sampling procedures are compared (table 1), the order of effectiveness of the insecticides is similar, in general. Only in the non-biased procedure, however, were the I-pound rates of heptachlor and lindane found to be significant. Further study of these sampling procedures may indicate that, if more than two biased root samples arc taken, the standard error may be decreased and the differences between the procedures in the statistical evaluation of the insecticides may be resolved. Two interesting points should be noted concerning the two sampling procedures. The means of the total length of feeding scars per root were higher in all the treatments in the biased sampling procedure than the corresponding six-roots-per-plot averages. As better control of larval feeding was obtained with an insecticide, there were, in general, less differences between the two means. These results would indicate that the vigor of the plant and possibly the size of the tap root could be important sources of variation to consider iii the evaluation of larval injury, especially if a small number of roots is sampled in each plot.},

   abstract = {Agricultural sustainability implies an increasing trend in per capita productivity to meet the present needs without jeopardizing the future potential. Soil tillage, soil surface management to alleviate soil-related constraints to crop production, is a basic and an important input with short- and long-term effects on sustainability. An important effect of soil tillage on sustainability is through its impact on the environment e.g. soil degradation, water quality, emission of greenhouse gases from soil-related processes, etc. The need to attain agricultural sustainability is particularly urgent in several tropical eco-regions and soils of low-carrying capacity in the tropics. Soil tillage influences atricultural sustainability through its effects on soil processes, soil properties, and crop growth. However, there is no one blueprint of a universally applicable sustainable tillage system. Appropriate tillage systems are soil- and crop-specific and their adaptation is governed by both biophysical and socio-economic factors. In addition to increasing crop yields, tillage methods must also facilitate soil and water conservation, improve root system development, maintain a favorable level of soil organic matter content, and reverse degradative in the soil's life-support processes. Important components or sub-systems of conservation-effective tillage systems include mulch farming, no-till or reduced tillage systems, use of cover crops and planted fallows, agroforestry, raised beds or ridge-tillage, and soil inversion or deep plowing. The ecological limits for the applicability of these components or sub-systems differ widely. The efforts of a multi-disciplinary team (comprising soil scientists, agricultural engineers, agronomists, economists and social scientists) are needed to develop site-specific tillage methods to achieve both short- and long-term goals of agricultural sustainability. © 1991.},

   abstract = {The stem solidness trait in wheat has been the most effective mechanism for management of the wheat stem sawfly (WSS) for six decades. However, recent results have shown that in certain genotypes, the degree of stem solidness is not a useful indicator of WSS resistance. A morphological characterization of solidness expression indicated that in the genotype ‘Conan’, very solid pith undergoes rapid retraction during stem maturation, resulting in significantly less solidness at maturity. In other solid-stemmed genotypes, including the standard WSS-resistant cultivar ‘Choteau’, dense pith in the stem remains nearly unchanged throughout plant development. In cage trials, ‘Conan’ plants were less preferred for oviposition by the WSS when paired with ‘Choteau’ plants. Field bioassays using near-isogenic lines differing for alleles at Qss.msub-3BL showed that the Conan allele provides higher levels of early stem solidness and rapid pith retraction during stem maturation. These results suggest that the traditional approach for increasing WSS resistance by selecting for increasing stem solidness needs to be modified to consider temporal variations in pith expression associated with alleles at Qss.msub-3BL.},

We performed greenhouse experiments over 2 yr to 1) study whether biotic (hollow versus solid stemmed host wheat) and abiotic (water, phosphorus stress) factors interact with C. cinctus stem mining to influence degree of mined stem physiological (photosynthesis) and yield (grain weight) reductions; and 2) determine whether whole plant yield compensatory responses occur to offset stem-mining reductions, Flag leaf photosynthetic reduction was not detected 1620 d after infestation, but were detected at 4042 d and doubled from water or phosphorus stresses. Main stem grain weight decreased from 10 to 25% from stem mining, largely due to reductions in grain size, with greater reductions under low phosphorus and/or water levels. Phosphorus-deficient plants without water stress were most susceptible to C. cinctus, more than doubling the grain weight reduction due to larval feeding relative to other water and phosphorus treatments. Two solid stemmed varieties with stem mining had less grain weight loss than a hollow stemmed variety, so greater internal mechanical resistance may reduce larval stem mining and plant yield reductions, Our results emphasize the importance of sufficient water and macronutrients for plants grown in regions impacted by C. cinctus. Also, solid stemmed varieties not only reduce wheat lodging from C. cinctus, they may reduce harvested grain losses from infested stems. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.},

We use an ontogenetic series of defensive gland secretions from larvae, three nymphal stages and adults of the oribatid model species Archegozetes longisetosus as a typical chemo-ecological data set to prepare a practical guide for compositional data analyses in chemical ecology. We compare various common and less common statistical and ordination methods to depict small quantitative and/or qualitative differences in compositional datasets: principal component analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), multivariate statistical tests (Anderson’s permutational multivariate analyses of variance = PERMANOVA; permutational analyses of multivariate dispersions = PERMDIPS), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the data mining algorithm Random Forests, bipartite network analysis and dynamic range boxes (dynRB). We summarize which methods are suitable for different research questions and how data needs to be structured and pre-processed. Network analyses and dynamic range boxes are promising tools for analyzing compositional data beyond the “classical” methods and provide additional information.},

Our objectives were to investigate: (i) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield, and nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUE), as affected by surface-applied N and crop rotation in no-till and tilled fields; and (ii) N availability and uptake as affected by tillage history and crop rotation. A study was imposed on adjacent long-term no-till (LTNT) and long-term sweep-tilled (LTST) fields for 6 yr. Wheat yield, N uptake, and soil NO3-N were measured for fallow (F)-winter wheat (WW), spring pea (Pisium sativum L.) (SP)-WW, spring wheat (SW)-WW, and winter pea (WP)-WW rotations with four N rates (0, 45, 90, or 135 kg ha-1). From fall to spring, soil NO3-N increased in F-WW, SP-WW, and WP-WW rotations, but not with SW-WW rotation. After spring application of urea to the soil surface of the LTNT field, WW biomass growth was greater in SP-WW than in SW-WW at lower N levels, but no differences were found between the SP-WW and SW-WW rotation at higher N rates. In the LTST field, no difference in biomass was found between the SP-WW and SW-WW rotations except for the 0 N rate. Winter wheat in rotation with pea greatly increased wheat yield, N uptake, and NUE. Lower WW yield and NUE in SW-WW rotation apparently resulted from less over-winter N release and the unavailability of surface-applied N. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

Fall-planted winter wheat originally avoided attack, but was consistently heavily damaged by 1985. We reviewed the factors affecting the recent adaptation of C. cinctus to winter wheat. No changes could be detected in the seasonal phenology of winter wheat. Decreased acreage of spring wheat from 1921 to 1945 reduced host availability. C. cinctus wasps are now emerging 20 d earlier than previously, and oviposition activity currently closely coincides with susceptible growth stages of winter wheat. Larval cannibalism of eggs and younger larvae also provides natural selection for early season activity. Annual emergence of wasps from a population in wild grasses consistently begins later than in wheat.},

By use of that method, complete wireworm populations have been obtained from soil samples of three types, two of which provide large homogeneous populations for detailed study while the third gives information about the seasonal and spatial infestation of fields. These collections show that the wireworm population of English pasture land is on the average about three times as large as has been commonly supposed. Populations have been found ranging up to ten millions per acre in the top 12 in. of soil. In two pastures studied intensively throughout the year, the wireworm population has been found to consist of large numbers of small larvae, decreasing numbers of larger larvae, and comparatively few of the very large larvae that have usually been allowed to represent the population. Such a composition is shown to be characteristic of wireworm populations under old grass at all seasons of the year and in several fields in different parts of the country. This result suggests that in research on the wireworm problem it is desirable to take into consideration the whole wireworm population throughout the year, not merely the large larvae during the cropping season.

   abstract = {Worldwide, the landscape homogeneity of extensive monocultures that characterizes conventional agriculture has resulted in the development of specialized and interacting multi-trophic pest complexes. While integrated pest management emphasizes the need to consider the ecological context where multiple species coexist, management recommendations are often based on single-species tactics. This approach may not provide satisfactory solutions when confronted with the complex interactions occurring between organisms at the same or different trophic levels. Replacement of the single-species management model with more sophisticated, multi-species programs requires an understanding of the direct and indirect interactions occurring between the crop and all categories of pests. We evaluated a modeling framework to make multi-pest management decisions taking into account direct and indirect interactions among species belonging to different trophic levels. We adopted a Bayesian decision theory approach in combination with path analysis to evaluate interactions between Bromus tectorum (downy brome, cheatgrass) and Cephus cinctus (wheat stem sawfly) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) systems. We assessed their joint responses to weed management tactics, seeding rates, and cultivar tolerance to insect stem boring or competition. Our results indicated that C. cinctus oviposition behavior varied as a function of B. tectorum pressure. Crop responses were more readily explained by the joint effects of management tactics on both categories of pests and their interactions than just by the direct impact of any particular management scheme on yield. In accordance, a C. cinc-tus tolerant variety should be planted at a low seeding rate under high insect pressure. However as B. tectorum levels increase, the C. cinctus tolerant variety should be replaced by a competitive and drought tolerant cultivar at high seeding rates despite C. cinctus infestation. This study exemplifies the necessity of accounting for direct and indirect biological PLOS ONE |},

Emphasis is placed on associative learning during the adult stage, the influence of preadult experience is discussed briefly. New data on learning in the species Leptopilina heterotoma are given. It is demonstrated that females can learn to respond to a novel odor, which they subsequently use in microhabitat selection. Learning was shown to be associative whereby host products (contact kairomone) or an oviposition experience could function as the reinforcers (reward). The effect of learning seemed stronger when parasitoids were rewarded with an oviposition experience. The paper concludes with a discussion on the application of parasitoid learning in pest management. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

   abstract = {Semiochemicals are defined as informative molecules mainly used in plant-insect or insectinsect interactions as alternative or complementary components to insecticide approaches in different integrated pest management strategies. They are used to manipulate insect behaviour by affecting the survival and/or reproduction of insect pests for controlling their infestations on crops. The present review provides a basic summary of the utilization of semiochemicals for controlling insect pests. Two main topics were explored in this study. The first topic focuses on a description of semiochemicals and their types (pheromones and allelochemicals). Pheromones represent an intraspecific communication amidst members of the same species. Allelochemicals, produced by individuals of one species, modify the behavior of individuals of a different species (i.e. an interspecific effect). Allelochemicals include different informative molecules such as: allomones, kairomones, synomones, antimones and apneumones. The second topic focuses on the application of semiochemicals in IPM programs. Different semiochemicals are included in integrated pest management programs in various ways such as monitoring, mass trapping, attract-and-kill, push-pull, and disruption strategies. Pheromones are promising and can be used singly or in integration with other control strategies for monitoring and controlling insect pests in agricultural systems. For example, sex pheromones have been applied in mass trapping, disruption and attract-and-kill tactics in IPM programs.},

The potential of insect pheromones to attract natural enemies has mainly been established under laboratory conditions, while semiochemicals from plants have been used to attract and retain natural enemies in field conditions using strategies such as trap crops and the push–pull mechanism. The best-known semiochemicals are those used for parasitoids–insect pest–plant host systems. Semiochemicals can also aid in the successful dispersal of entomopathogenic microbials. The use of semiochemicals to disseminate microbial pathogens is still at the initial stage, especially for bacterial and viral entomopathogens. Future studies should focus on the integration of semiochemicals into management strategies for insects, for which several semiochemical compounds have already been studied. More effective formulations of microbial agents, such as granular formulations of entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs), along with bio-degradable trap materials, could improve this strategy. Furthermore, more studies to evaluate species-specific tactics may be needed, especially where more than one key pest is present.},

   abstract = {β-Ocimene is a very common plant volatile released in important amounts from the leaves and flowers of many plant species. This acyclic monoterpene can play several biological functions in plants, by potentially affecting floral visitors and also by mediating defensive responses to herbivory. The ubiquity and high relative abundance of β-ocimene in the floral scents of species from most plant families and from different pollination syndromes (ranging from generalism to specialism) strongly suggest that this terpenoid may play an important role in the attraction of pollinators to flowers. We compiled abundant evidence from published studies that supports β-ocimene as a generalist attractant of a wide spectrum of pollinators. We found no studies testing behavioural responses of pollinators to β-ocimene, that could directly demonstrate or deny the function of β-ocimene in pollinator attraction; but several case studies support that the emissions of β-ocimene in flowers of different species follow marked temporal and spatial patterns of emission, which are typical from floral volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions that are involved in pollinator attraction. Furthermore, important β-ocimene emissions are induced from vegetative plant tissues after herbivory in many species, which have relevant functions in the establishment of tritrophic interactions. We thus conclude that β-ocimene is a key plant volatile with multiple relevant functions in plants, depending on the organ and the time of emission. Experimental behavioural studies on pure β-ocimene conducted with pollinating insects will be necessary to prove the assumptions made here.},

   abstract = {Adults of B. cephi emerged at the same time as the adults of their host, the wheat stem sawfly, and started to oviposit about mid-July. The second generation started to emerge between August 5 and 15. This generation, which was complete in some years, was apparently only partial in years in which adults of the first generation continued to oviposit late in the season. In most cases the larvae of Bracon that were present at harvest time were from eggs laid after August 1. Most of the overwintering B. cephi were located in the lower internodes of the sawfly-infested wheat stems. Although B. cephi attacked some sawfly larvae in their stubs most sawflies escaped parasitism once they had cut their host stems. High host densities per stem in hollow-stemmed wheats were detrimental to Bracon during the early part of the season as the unparasitized sawfly larvae in stems containing B. cephi destroyed the parasite larvae. The sawfly-susceptible wheats were more suitable than the resistant for parasitism. Generally, differences in parasitism between wheats and between barleys were caused by differences in length of survival of the sawfly larvae in the different host plants; longer survival led to higher parasitism. The fluctuations in amounts of parasitism mainly depended on the synchronization of development between B. cephi and the sawfly. Parasitism increased when the sawfly larvae cut their host stems sufficiently late to allow establishment by the second generation of B. cephi and decreased when the sawfly cut too early for parasitism by the second generation. The date of ripening of the host plant governs the date of cutting by the sawfly; hence, the amount of parasitism is influenced by the levels of soil moisture and temperature during the growing season, by differences in rate of development of various plant hosts, and by the date of seeding. Low levels of parasitism resulted from early ripening of the sawfly host plants in two consecutive years, whereas a moderately high level occurred even though the weather of the current year was conducive to early ripening, provided that the wheat in the preceding year had ripened late. It appears that moderate to high levels of parasitism required that the crop ripen late in at least one year out of two. © 1963, Entomological Society of Canada. All rights reserved.},

This may be due to the lack of objectively measured sitting time or because socioeconomic confounders were not considered in the analysis. Objectives: To investigate the association between objectively measured sitting time (daily total, and occupational and leisure-time periods) and LBP among blue-collar workers. Methods: Two-hundred-and-one blue-collar workers wore two accelerometers (GT3X+ Actigraph) for up to four consecutive working days to obtain objective measures of sitting time, estimated via Acti4 software. Workers reported their LBP intensity the past month on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 9 (worst imaginable pain) and were categorized into either low (≤5) or high (>5) LBP intensity groups. In the multivariate-adjusted binary logistic regression analysis, total sitting time, and occupational and leisure-time sitting were both modeled as continuous (hours/day) and categorical variables (i.e. low, moderate and high sitting time). Results: The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant positive association between total sitting time (per hour) and high LBP intensity (odds ratio; OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.15-1.77, P=0.01). Similar results were obtained for leisure-time sitting (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.10-1.91, P=0.01), and a similar but non-significant trend was obtained for occupational sitting time (OR=1.34, 95%CI 0.99-1.82, P=0.06). In the analysis on categorized sitting time, high sitting time was positively associated with high LBP for total (OR=3.31, 95% CI=1.18-9.28, P=0.03), leisure (OR=5.31, 95%CI=1.57-17.90, P=0.01), and occupational (OR=3.26, 95%CI=0.89-11.98, P=0.08) periods, referencing those with low sitting time. Conclusion: Sitting time is positively associated with LBP intensity among blue-collar workers. Future studies using a prospective design with objective measures of sitting time are recommended.},

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus, is a major pest of wheat and key ecological player in the grasslands of western North America. It also represents the distinctive Cephoidea superfamily of sawflies (Symphyta) that appeared early during the hymenopteran radiation, but after three early-branching eusymphytan superfamilies that form the base of the order Hymenoptera. We present a high-quality draft genome assembly of 162 Mb in 1,976 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 622 kb. Automated gene annotation identified 11,210 protein-coding gene models and 1,307 noncoding RNA models. Thirteen percent of the assembly consists of 58,000 transposable elements partitioned equally between Class-I and Class-II elements. Orthology analysis reveals that 86% of Cephus proteins have identifiable orthologs in other insects. Phylogenomic analysis of conserved subsets of these proteins supports the placement of the Cephoidea between the Eusymphyta and the parasitic woodwasp superfamily Orussoidea. Manual annotation and phylogenetic analysis of families of odorant, gustatory, and ionotropic receptors, plus odorant-binding proteins, shows that Cephus has representatives for most conserved and expanded gene lineages in the Apocrita (wasps, ants, and bees). Cephus has also maintained several insect gene lineages that have been lost from the Apocrita, most prominently the carbon dioxide receptor subfamily. Furthermore, Cephus encodes a few small lineage-specific chemoreceptor gene family expansions that might be involved in adaptations to new grasses including wheat. These comparative analyses identify gene family members likely to have been present in the hymenopteran ancestor and provide a new perspective on the evolution of the chemosensory gene repertoire.},

History has shown us that without these data, conservation decisions often weaken, rather than enhance, population viability. This is especially true in changing landscapes. We review knowledge of vital rates across all at-risk butterflies. We have information on movement for 17 of 283 butterfly species and information on demography for 19 species. We find that habitat-specific movement behavior is key to understanding how to connect populations, and habitat-specific demography is central to managing habitats. Methods and analyses worked out for butterflies can provide a scaffold around which to build studies for the conservation of other at-risk insects.},

   abstract = {It is often claimed that we do not understand the forces driving the global diversity gradient. However, an extensive literature suggests that contemporary climate constrains terrestrial taxonomic richness over broad geographic extents. Here, we review the empirical literature to examine the nature and form of the relationship between climate and richness. Our goals were to document the support for the climatically based energy hypothesis, and within the constraints imposed by correlative analyses, to evaluate two versions of the hypothesis: the productivity and ambient energy hypotheses. Focusing on studies extending over 800 km, we found that measures of energy, water, or water-energy balance explain spatial variation in richness better than other climatic and non-climatic variables in 82 of 85 cases. Even when considered individually and in isolation, water/ energy variables explain on average over 60% of the variation in the richness of a wide range of plant and animal groups. Further, water variables usually represent the strongest predictors in the tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate zones, whereas energy variables (for animals) or water-energy variables (for plants) dominate in high latitudes. We conclude that the interaction between water and energy, either directly or indirectly (via plant productivity), provides a strong explanation for globally extensive plant and animal diversity gradients, but for animals there also is a latitudinal shift in the relative importance of ambient energy vs. water moving from the poles to the equator. Although contemporary climate is not the only factor influencing species richness and may not explain the diversity pattern for all taxonomic groups, it is clear that understanding water-energy dynamics is critical to future biodiversity research. Analyses that do not include water-energy variables are missing a key component for explaining broad-scale patterns of diversity.},

Such a framework would not only delay resistance evolution in pests, but also optimize each element of the management and increase the synergies between them. Here, we outline key areas within IPM that would especially benefit from a thorough evolutionary understanding. In addition, we discuss the difficulties and advantages of enhancing communication among research communities rooted in different biological disciplines and between researchers and society.

   abstract = {It has been known for centuries that floral and extra-floral nectar secreted by plants attracts and rewards animals. Extra-floral nectar is involved in so-called indirect defense by attracting animals (generally ants) that prey on herbivores, or by discouraging herbivores from feeding on the plant. Floral nectar is presented inside the flower close to the reproductive organs and rewards animals that perform pollination while visiting the flower. In both cases nectar is a source of carbon and nitrogen compounds that feed animals, the most abundant solutes being sugars and amino acids. Plant–animal relationships involving the two types of nectar have therefore been used for a long time as text-book examples of symmetric mutualism: services provided by animals to plants in exchange for food provided by plants to animals. Cheating (or deception or exploitation), namely obtaining the reward/service without returning any counterpart, is however, well-known in mutualistic relationships, since the interacting partners have conflicting interests and selection may favor cheating strategies. A more subtle way of exploiting mutualism was recently highlighted. It implies the evolution of strategies to maximize the benefits obtained by one partner while still providing the reward/service to the other partner. Several substances other than sugars and amino acids have been found in nectar and some affect the foraging behavior of insects and potentially increase the benefits to the plant. Such substances can be considered plant cues to exploit mutualism. Recent evidence motivated some authors to use the term “manipulation” of animals by plants in nectar-mediated mutualistic relationships. This review highlights the recent background of the “manipulation” hypothesis, discussing it in the framework of new ecological and evolutionary scenarios in plant–animal interactions, as a stimulus for future research.},

   abstract = {Deterministic seasonality can explain the evolution of alternative life history phenotypes (i.e., life history polyphenism) expressed in different generations emerging within the same year. However, the influence of stochastic variation on the expression of such life history polyphenisms in seasonal environments is insufficiently understood. Here, we use insects as a model and explore (1) the effects of stochastic variation in seasonality and (2) the life cycle on the degree of life history differentiation among the alternative developmental pathways of direct development and diapause (overwintering), and (3) the evolution of phenology. With numerical simulation, we determine the values of development (growth) time, growth rate, body size, reproductive effort, adult life span, and fecundity in both the overwintering and directly developing generations that maximize geometric mean fitness. The results suggest that natural selection favors the expression of alternative life histories in the alternative developmental pathways even when there is stochastic variation in seasonality, but that trait differentiation is affected by the developmental stage that overwinters. Increasing environmental unpredictability induced a switch to a bet-hedging type of life history strategy, which is consistent with general life history theory. Bet-hedging appeared in our study system as reduced expression of the direct development phenotype, with associated changes in life history phenotypes, because the fitness value of direct development is highly variable in uncertain environments. Our main result is that seasonality itself is a key factor promoting the evolution of seasonally polyphenic life histories but that environmental stochasticity may modulate the expression of life history phenotypes.},

Cultural services and non-use values are included in all major typologies and present some of the most compelling reasons for conserving ecosystems, though many barriers exist to their explicit characterization. The values that conform least well to economic assumptions-variously lumped together with/as cultural services-have proven elusive in part because valuation is complicated by the properties of intangibility and incommensurability, which has in turn led to their exclusion from economic valuation. We argue that the effectiveness of the ecosystem services framework in decision-making is thwarted by (i) conflation of services, values, and benefits, and (ii) failure to appropriately treat diverse kinds of values. We address this challenge by (1) distinguishing eight dimensions of values, which have implications for appropriate valuation and decision-making; (2) demonstrating the interconnected nature of benefits and services, and so the ubiquity of intangible values; (3) discussing the implications of these propositions for ecosystem-services research; and (4) outlining briefly a research agenda to enable decision-making that is ecologically appropriate and socially just. Because many ecosystem services (co-)produce 'cultural' benefits, full characterization of services must address non-material values through methods from diverse social sciences. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

To date such plastic shifts of life-history traits in response to parasitism are only known from solitary organisms where infected individuals can react by themselves. In the case of social insects, where brood care and reproductive effort is shared between reproductive individuals (typically the queen) and workers, adjustments of the reproductive effort would depend on collective decision-making. We tested for this possibility by experimentally activating the immune response of individual workers in colonies of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L. This induction resulted, in combination with environmental conditions, in a reduction of fitness of the social unity (i.e. colony success, measured by number and biomass of offspring) and a collective response towards earlier reproduction. As both phenomena are expressed at the level of the colony, the result suggests that key elements of the use of immune defence have been maintained through the evolutionary transition to sociality.},

   abstract = {1. Resource acquisition and allocation are the physiological mechanisms integrating foraging and life-history traits. An understanding of the patterns of acquisition and allocation in different environments and organisms is critical to a predictive theory of life history. 2. Here I develop an allocation framework, which provides a template for conceptualizing the interactions among resource acquisition, allocation and life-history traits. The framework describes the process through which food is taken in by an organism at specific life stages, then allocated to growth, survival (including maintenance, defence, dispersal, etc), reproduction and further foraging. 3. I use the allocation framework to examine allocation to life-history traits in insects under both benign and stressful environments. Stressful environments result from resource scarcity or harsh environmental conditions. I consider effects of consistent stress or variable stress across time. 4. Several broad generalizations emerge from empirical studies, viewed in the allocation framework. First, resource congruence, or the requirement for specific nutrient ratios in, for example, eggs, results in different limiting nutrients for each life-history trait. Second, the timing of resource acquisition affects both allocation patterns and the identity of limiting nutrients for a given life-history trait. Third, physiological trade-offs may occur across, not just within, life stages. Fourth, apparent trade-offs may be driven by differences among traits in resource congruence constraints and deleterious effects of excess nutrients on a particular trait. Fifth, allocation response to environmental stress shows age-specific and sex-specific patterns. Sixth, physiological trade-offs are often more pronounced under environmental stress. Finally, even within insects, there is considerable variability in allocation response to environmental stress. We do not yet have sufficiently diverse and thorough case studies to understand why this is so. Studies in the wild, or relating laboratory conditions to wild environments, are also needed. 5. Senescence can also be understood in an allocation framework. The present approach provides a necessary functional basis for understanding patterns of senescence in diverse organisms and environments. 6. The allocation framework fosters a mechanistic understanding of life-history patterns, and the beginning of an understanding of the processes underlying those patterns.},

Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Yet the challenge is for people to appreciate and care for nature, including insects, on which we so crucially depend for so many services. Current environmental policy is often a dichotomy of mutually exclusive opposites: instrumental valuation vs. intrinsic valuation. This unhelpful division can be overcome by valuing nature through appreciation of spatial extent (local to global) relative to biological level (gene through population and species, to ecosystem) and understanding that human well-being is a two-way process of caring for nature ↔ nature providing a well-being platform for us. However, human relationships with nature are complex, as they are with insects too. The human brain is not well equipped to deal with topics that are complex, seemingly far away in space and time, and are nebulous. These topics beget inaction by the public at large on, for example, global change. Neither are we well equipped to value insects, despite scientific understanding of their importance to our well-being. However, we are at least rising to the pollination crisis, as we can relate to the tangible bee and our food security. To improve insect conservation awareness and action, we need to engage insect conservation psychology. Citizen science and Red Listing are playing major roles here, as is the camera, which magnifies and makes insects more meaningful to us. Using insect conservation psychology, we are better able to instill a culture of personal and social responsibility, and so create political will to drive insect conservation from paper to action.},

Teasing apart the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors affecting animal population dynamics is a difficult task when based solely on the analysis of natural populations. Experimental manipulations of systems using microcosm studies can be powerful tools for probing such interactions, but microcosms are ultimately limited by their lack of complexity compared with nature. Hunter and Kozlov (2019) take a novel field-based experimental approach to studying abiotic influences on biotic interactions by quantifying how the presence of a pollutant source alters biotic processes driving populations of a forest leaf miner. They find that populations in proximity to a pollutant source show weaker direct density dependence and stronger delayed density dependence than more distant populations unaffected by pollution. These differences in density dependence cause higher equilibrium densities near the pollution source but surprisingly they do not alter leaf miner oscillatory dynamics. This creative study provides useful insight into how abiotic forces alter biotic population processes and how density dependence shapes the spatial dynamics of animal populations.},

Mechanisms that can balance the benefits associated with increased growth are poorly understood, raising the question: what keeps insects from becoming larger? If predation risk was to increase with juvenile size, it would make an extension of development very risky, favouring smaller final sizes. But field measures of juvenile mortality seldom show any general patterns of size dependence. We here therefore try to estimate a mechanistic relationship between juvenile size and predation risk by exposing the larvae of two closely related butterflies to a generalist invertebrate predator in a laboratory experiment. Predation risk increased with larval size but was not affected by the species-specific growth rate differences. These results indicate that predation risk may increase with the size of the juvenile even when predators are relatively small. By basing a model simulation on our data we also show that size dependent predation of the kind found in this study has potential to stabilise selection on body size in these species. Thus, these findings suggest that more detailed studies of the size dependence of predation risk on juvenile instars will increase the understanding of what it is that keeps insects small. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

The widespread application of these tools has brought with it an emerging understanding that patterns in biogeography, introduction history and subsequent movement and spread of many invasive alien insects are far more complex than previously thought. We reviewed the literature and found that for a number of invasive insects, there is strong and growing evidence that multiple introductions, complex global movement, and population admixture in the invaded range are commonplace. Additionally, historical paradigms related to species and strain identities and origins of common invaders are in many cases being challenged. This has major consequences for our understanding of basic biology and ecology of invasive insects and impacts quarantine, management and biocontrol programs. In addition, we found that founder effects rarely limit fitness in invasive insects and may benefit populations (by purging harmful alleles or increasing additive genetic variance). Also, while phenotypic plasticity appears important post-establishment, genetic diversity in invasive insects is often higher than expected and increases over time via multiple introductions. Further, connectivity among disjunct regions of global invasive ranges is generally far higher than expected and is often asymmetric, with some populations contributing disproportionately to global spread. We argue that the role of connectivity in driving the ecology and evolution of introduced species with multiple invasive ranges has been historically underestimated and that such species are often best understood in a global context.},

For the butterfly Speyeria mormonia, one climate driver, snow melt date, has multiple effects on population growth. Snow melt date in year t has density-dependent indirect effects.

Currently, several other ecologically relevant traits mediated by endosymbionts are being investigated, including enhanced parasite resistance, enhanced heat tolerance, and influences on insect-plant interactions such as manipulation of plant physiology to the benefit of the insect. 3. Traits mediated by endosymbionts are often identified by correlative studies where traits are found to be altered in the presence of a particular symbiont. Recent developments in genomic tools offer the opportunity for studying the impact of bacteria-insect symbioses under natural conditions in a population and community ecology context. In vivo experiments specifically testing putative functions of endosymbionts in parallel to population-level studies on the prevalence of endosymbionts allow disentangling host versus symbiont contribution to phenotypic variability observed in individuals. Effects of symbionts on host phenotype are often large and relevant to host fitness, e.g. by significantly enhancing survival or fecundity in a context-dependent manner. 4. Predominantly vertically transmitted endosymbionts contribute to the heritable genetic variation present in a host species. Phenotypic variation on which selection can act may be due to differences either among host genomes, symbiont genomes, or genotype × genotype interactions. Therefore the holobiont, i.e. the host including all symbionts, should be regarded as the unit of selection as the association between host and symbionts may affect the fitness of the holobiont depending on the environment. © 2011 The Author.

Top-down control can be strengthened when natural enemies complement each other, dampened by negative interactions, balanced by both factors, and driven by single luential species. A meta-analytic synthesis shows a significant overall effect of enemy richness increasing top-down control of herbivores, which is consistent in agricultural studies conducted in tropical versus temperate zones, in studies using caged versus open-field designs, but not so in nonagricultural habitats.

Where identified, indirect effects to other taxa can be wide-ranging and include ecological benefits in certain habitats or locations. Here, we simultaneously examine the direct and indirect effects of a common, invasive grass species (Microstegium vimineum) on the invertebrate communities of understory deciduous forests in the eastern United States. To do this, we use two complementary analytic approaches to compare invaded and reference plots: (a) community composition analysis of understory arthropod taxa and (b) analysis of isotopic carbon and nitrogen ratios of a representative predatory spider species. Invaded plots contained a significantly greater abundance of nearly all taxa, including predators, herbivores, and detritivores. Spider communities contained over seven times more individuals and exhibited greater species diversity and richness in invaded plots. Surprisingly, however, the abundant invertebrate community is not nutritionally supported by the invasive plant, despite 100% ground cover of M. vimineum. Instead, spider isotopic carbon ratios showed that the invertebrate prey community found within invaded plots was deriving energy from the plant tissue of C3 plants and not the prevalent, aboveground M. vimineum. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that invasive M. vimineum can create non-nutritional ecological benefits for some invertebrate taxa, with potential impacts to the nutritional dynamics of invertebrate–vertebrate food webs. These positive impacts, however, may be restricted to habitats that experience high levels of ungulate herbivory or reduced vegetative structural complexity. Our results highlight the importance of fully understanding taxon- and habitat-specific effects of invading plant species when prioritizing invasive species removal or management efforts.},

   abstract = {Induced plant defenses in response to herbivore attack are modulated by cross-talk between jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathways. Oral secretions from some insect herbivores contain effectors that overcome these antiherbivore defenses. Herbivores possess diverse microbes in their digestive systems and these microbial symbionts can modify plant-insect interactions; however, the specific role of herbivore-associated microbes in manipulating plant defenses remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) larvae exploit bacteria in their oral secretions to suppress antiherbivore defenses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We found that antibiotic-untreated larvae decreased production of JA and JA-responsive antiherbivore defenses, but increased SA accumulation and SA-responsive gene expression. Beetles benefit from down-regulating plant defenses by exhibiting enhanced larval growth. In SA-deficient plants, suppression was not observed, indicating that suppression of JA-regulated defenses depends on the SA-signaling pathway. Applying bacteria isolated from larval oral secretions to wounded plants confirmed that three microbial symbionts belonging to the genera Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter are responsible for defense suppression. Additionally, reinoculation of these bacteria to antibiotic-treated larvae restored their ability to suppress defenses. Flagellin isolated from Pseudomonas sp. was associated with defense suppression. Our findings show that the herbivore exploits symbiotic bacteria as a decoy to deceive plants into incorrectly perceiving the threat as microbial. By interfering with the normal perception of herbivory, beetles can evade antiherbivore defenses of its host.},

   abstract = {Here we elucidate and justify a DNA barcode approach to insect species description that can be applied to name tens of thousands of species of Ichneumonoidea and many other species-rich taxa. Each description consists of a lateral habitus image of the specimen, a COI barcode diagnosis, and the holotype specimen information required by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. We believe this approach, or a slight modification of it, will be useful for many other underdescribed hyperdiverse taxa, especially in the tropics. Due to the extreme species-richness of the Ichneumonoidea, the very low percentage of described species, and the lack of detailed biological information for most described species, the standard taxonomic approach is inefficient and overwhelmingly time consuming. A DNA barcode-based approach to initial description will provide a solid foundation of species hypotheses from which more comprehensive descriptions can be developed as other data, time, and budgets permit. Here we elucidate this view and detailed methodology that can generally be applied to species-rich underdescribed taxa. A real example is given by describing species in two genera, Hemichoma and Zelomorpha, reared from the área de Conservación Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica.

This symbiotic association leads to the formation of holobiont (host and its symbionts). This mutual coexistence is not merely at the physical or chemical level but also at the genetic level leading to the emergence of the concept of hologenome (gene pool of host and its associated symbionts). The abundance of symbionts with the associated gene diversity contributes to the fitness of the holobiont under varying environmental conditions. The hologenome theory of evolution considers the dynamic holobiont as a single unit for natural selection and provides a more accommodating view of evolution blending Darwinism and Lamarkism.

An earlier model suggested that a mixed strategy of producing nectarful and nectarless flowers would be evolutionarily stable. Here we compare nectarless flowers as a cheating strategy with three competing hypotheses namely "visit-more-flowers", "cross-pollination enhancement" and "better contact". We collected field data on 28 species of plants to test some of the differential predictions of the hypotheses. Nectarless flowers were detected in 24 out of 28 plant species. Correlations of percent nectarless flowers with floral and ecological variables support the cheater flower hypothesis. We further model the cost-benefits of cheating and show that an evolutionary stable ratio of nectarless to nectarful flowers can be reached. The equilibrium ratio is mainly decided by factors associated with pollinator density and pollinator learning.},

   abstract = {The majority of flowering plants relies on animal pollinators for sexual reproduction and many animal pollina-tors rely on floral resources. However, interests of plants and pollinators are often not the same, resulting in an asymmetric relationship that ranges from mutualistic to parasitic interactions. Our understanding of the processes that underlie this asymmetry remains fragmentary. In this Review, we bring together evidence from evolutionary biology, plant chemistry, biomechanics, sensory ecology and behaviour to illustrate that the degree of symmetry often depends on the perspective taken. We also highlight variation in (a)symmetry within and between plant and pollinator species as well as between geographic locations. Through taking different perspectives from the plant and pollinator sides we provide new ground for studies on the maintenance and evolution of animal pollination and on the (a)symmetry in plant-pollinator interactions. Introduction The fascinating interaction between plants and pollinators is sometimes referred to as a mutual partnership 1 , but the interaction is driven by the different and often conflicting interests of plants and pollinators. Plants need reliable pollen dispersal and receipt at minimal costs, whereas pollinators seek floral rewards that can be harvested as quickly and efficiently as possible. The resulting interaction is sometimes referred to as (balanced) mutual exploitation 2. Plants and pollinators have evolved traits that influence the balance of this mutual exploitation to their advantage 3-5 (Figure 1). Plants essentially face two connected challenges: how to optimise the amount of reward offered to actual pollina-tors and how to prevent access to floral resources by flower visitors that collect rewards but do not pollinate. To quote Danforth and colleagues 3 : ''pollinators are like an overly demanding lover-they are great to have around at times, but if left without boundaries, they can take over your life and ruin it.'' Many plant adaptations restrict access to floral rewards in a variety of ways, ranging from morphological to mechanical or chemical boundaries. Conversely, pollinators evolved strategies to increase exploitation of floral resources to their advantage , such as morphological, behavioural and/or physiological adaptations. The suite of co-evolved adaptations mediates a tension between plants and pollinators, which results in different types of interactions. The relative benefit for plants versus pollinators ranges from solely beneficial for flower visitors (e.g., reward robbing), to more balanced interactions, to solely beneficial for plants (e.g., pollination by deception) (Figure 1). Understanding the different aspects of the tension between plants and pollina-tors calls for a cross-disciplinary view, because the traits involved span across different scientific domains.},

   abstract = {The success of species in a community is determined not only by the direct interactions between species but also by indirect interactions. Indirect effects will occur if an associate species changes the abundance of intermediate species in a chain of interactions that ultimately affect the growth of some focal species. A model of species interactions in a community is presented here and used to quantify direct and indirect effects in a five-species weedy plant community. This method quantifies indirect effects by measuring changes in the abundance of the intermediate species and then estimating how such changes will affect the focal species. The experiments demonstrated that the direct effects in this community were generally negative (competitive) and could be quite large. Indirect effects were positive (facilitative) and negatively correlated with the direct effects, which thus acted to mitigate the usually larger competitive effects. The magnitudes of most species interactions in this community were primarily determined by large direct effects of Ambrosia artemisiifolia and, to a lesser extent, Agropyron repens. The species that exhibited the least competitive release following the removal of a competitor were those that were the most suppressed, because of the nonlinear nature of their response to increasing abundance of competitors. Each species in a community is affected by interactions with many other species. Understanding this complex set of interactions involves determining a combined effect of the many often simultaneous species interactions in which any single species is participating. This understanding has proven elusive, and several authors have even suggested that it may, at present, be beyond our grasp (Brown 1981; Simberloff 1982). Much of the difficulty appears to stem from indirect effects through the linkages or loops (Levins 1975) of interactions connecting different species. I define an indirect effect of an "associate" species on a "focal" species as that produced when the associate species changes the direct effect of one or more other associate species on the focal species. This definition encompasses what other authors have termed indirect effects (see, e.g. For example, a predator that changes the abundance or behavior of a prey species , and thus alters the effect of that species on its own prey, has an indirect effect across a trophic level on the resource species of its prey.

The response of communities, driven by the direct effects of ocean change on individual species as well the cascade of indirect effects, has received far less study. We used several rocky intertidal species including crabs, whelks, juvenile abalone, and mussels to determine how feeding, growth, and interactions between species could be shifted by changing ocean conditions. Our 10 wk experiment revealed many complex outcomes which highlight the unpredictability of community-level responses. Contrary to our predictions, the largest impact of elevated CO2 was reduced crab feeding and survival, with a pH drop of 0.3 units. Surprisingly, whelks showed no response to higher temperatures or CO2 levels, while abalone shells grew 40 % less under high CO2 conditions. Massive non-consumptive effects of crabs on whelks showed how important indirect effects can be in deter mining climate change responses. Predictions of species outcomes that account solely for physiological responses to climate change do not consider the potentially large role of indirect effects due to species interactions. For strongly linked species (e.g. predator-prey or competitor relationships), the indirect effects of climate change are much less known than direct effects, but may be far more powerful in reshaping future marine com munities.},

When both predators contributed to lowering apple rust mite growth, T. pyri acted earlier in the season than did Z. mali. Predation by T. pyri was not affected by plant quality (nitrogen content or cultivar), but predation by Z. mali was enhanced by high nitrogen levels and was influenced by cultivar. There was little evidence of direct competition between Panonychus ulmi and apple rust mite in these orchards, possibly due to the low densities of P. ulmi. The indirect effects were generally smaller than the direct effects, but were occasionally important. Apparent competition between P. ulmi and apple rust mite was observed at times in some orchards, more often mediated by Z. mali than by T. pyri.

   abstract = {More than 60% of U.S. wheat is grown in the Great Plains. Three classes of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - hard red spring, hard red winter, and hard white - and durum (T. turgidum L. var. durum) occupy 16 million ha in the region and provide most of the U.S. grain for baked goods and pasta. This article relates the early history of the four classes and the key persons involved in their establishment. Pioneers faced many difficulties in settling the Plains, but the need for adapted cultivars was paramount. Three cultivars - 'Red Fife' hard red spring wheat, 'Turkey'-type hard red winter wheat, and 'Kubanka' durum wheat - were the foundation for the industry. Red Fife was selected by D.A. Fife of Ontario in 1842. The cultivar spread to the northern U.S. Plains during the 1860s and dominated production for 40 yr. Turkey hard red winter wheat was introduced to Kansas by Mennonite settlers from the Ukraine, particularly B. Warkentin, in 1873 and was advanced by C.C. Georgeson, who recognized its potential. Another cultivar, 'Kharkof', introduced by M.A. Carleton in 1900, stimulated spread of the class throughout the Plains. Carleton also introduced Kubanka in 1900 and promoted its utilization to start the U.S. durum industry. The most recent class, hard white wheat, was initiated by E.G. Heyne and approved by the USDA in 1990. These wheats transformed American agriculture by opening a vast area for production, shifting the center of cultivation to the Plains, and changing the country into a major grain exporter.

Litter mass and C pool for the perennial grasses were greater than those for triticale. Litter C and N pools generally decreased with increased grazing intensity. Root mass was greater for the perennial grasses than for triticale at all grazing intensities. Meadow bromegrass generally produced more root mass than smooth bromegrass. Root C and N pools for triticale were 31 and 27%, respectively, of that for the perennial grasses. Estimated total C contribution (roots and litter) to the resistant soil organic C pool was 1.5 times greater for light compared to heavy grazing. Total C (litter + root) contribution for perennial grasses was 2.7 times greater than that for triticale. Perennial grasses provided a larger litter base and root system that promote greater storage of C in the soil compared with triticale.},

Wireworms (Agriotes sputator) were distributed among the twenty stations in a non-random manner.2. In this field, the wireworm distribution was correlated to a highly significant degree with nine factors (loss on ignition, organic carbon, nitrogen, Lolium, Agrostis, Chilopoda, staphylinid larvae, ants and Nematocera) and to a significant degree with three factors (altitude, pH of the soil and Diplopoda).3. Among these factors, three (the organic content of the soil as measured by loss on ignition, the prevalence of the grass Lolium, and the numbers of staphylinid larvae) were found by analysis to be most significantly correlated with the wireworm distribution.4. Sixteen stations were set up in a grass plot of ¼ acre, and twenty-one soil samples were examined from each station during a period of 3 years. The distribution of wireworms at these stations was markedly non-random throughout the sampling period, some stations being consistently three or four times as heavily infested as others only 5 yd away.5. Within this plot the distribution of wireworms was correlated to a highly significant degree with altitude, depth of loam and amount of soil moisture at 3 and at 9 in depth. It was significantly correlated with the lime content of the soil. Ranunculus was prevalent on an area of low wireworm infestation.6. Among the factors studied in this plot, the amount of soil moisture at 3 in. depth was most important. It was negatively correlated with the distribution of wireworms.7. Within the plot, stations having high wireworm populations were infested almost exclusively by Agriotes sputator; those having low wireworm populations were infested about equally by A. sputator and A. ‘obscurus-lineatus’.8. Four square-yard samples were examined, each in eighty-one quadrats 4 in. square. Within each square yard, the wireworms were not distributed at random and independently, but were markedly aggregated.9. Separation of the wireworms collected from these samples into three size groups showed that the non-random distribution in square-yard samples was largely due to the small larvae, which were strongly aggregated . The medium-sized larvae were less markedly aggregated. The distribution of the large larvae under grass was not significantly different from a random distribution.10. To understand the factors controlling wireworm distribution it will be necessary to consider the distribution of the different larval age-groups.11. Two suggestions are made towards an explanation of the geographical distribution of wireworms in England.12. Study of the spatial distribution of wireworms raises some of the major problems of ecology and, in particular, illustrates the interdependence of spatial distribution and seasonal succession.},

   abstract = {Background: We recently reported a link between use of the organophosphate pesticide phorate and risk of prostate cancer among applicators with a family history of prostate cancer in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). Objective: This findings, together with findings of associations between other organophosphate pesticides and cancer more broadly, prompted us to examine phorate exposure and overall cancer incidence in the AHS. Adding 3 years of follow-up and using more detailed exposure information allowed us to see whether the prostate cancer finding held. Methods: The AHS is a prospective study of licensed restricted-use pesticide applicators from North Carolina and Iowa. To our knowledge, this is the largest examination of workers occupationally exposed to phorate. Pesticide exposure and other information was collected using two self-administered questionnaires completed from 1993 to 1997. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Phorate use was not related to the incidence of all cancers combined or to any individual cancer, although we had insufficient numbers to study non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia, which have been linked to organophosphates in other studies. Although prostate cancer risk was not significantly related to phorate use overall or among those without a family history, the risk tended to increase among applicators with a family history of prostate cancer. The interaction RR was 1.53 (95% CI, 0.99-2.37). Conclusion: The observed statistical interaction suggests a gene-environment interaction between family history and phorate exposure in the incidence of prostate cancer, but other explanations are also possible.},

   abstract = {For the vast majority of chemicals that have cancer potency estimates on IRIS, the underlying database is deficient with respect to early-life exposures. This data gap has prevented derivation of cancer potency factors that are relevant to this time period, and so assessments may not fully address children's risks. This article provides a review of juvenile animal bioassay data in comparison to adult animal data for a broad array of carcinogens. This comparison indicates that short-term exposures in early life are likely to yield a greater tumor response than short-term exposures in adults, but similar tumor response when compared to long-term exposures in adults. This evidence is brought into a risk assessment context by proposing an approach that: (1) does not prorate children's exposures over the entire life span or mix them with exposures that occur at other ages; (2) applies the cancer slope factor from adult animal or human epidemiology studies to the children's exposure dose to calculate the cancer risk associated with the early-life period; and (3) adds the cancer risk for young children to that for older children/adults to yield a total lifetime cancer risk. The proposed approach allows for the unique exposure and pharmacokinetic factors associated with young children to be fully weighted in the cancer risk assessment. It is very similar to the approach currently used by U.S. EPA for vinyl chloride. The current analysis finds that the database of early life and adult cancer bioassays supports extension of this approach from vinyl chloride to other carcinogens of diverse mode of action. This approach should be enhanced by early-life data specific to the particular carcinogen under analysis whenever possible.},

   abstract = {Wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, is an economically serious pest of cereals grown in North America. Barley cultivars were previously planted as resistant crops in rotations to manage C. cinctus, but due to increasing levels of injury to this crop, this is no longer a valid management tactic in Montana. Therefore, we aimed to understand antixenosis (behavioral preference), antibiosis (mortality), and potential yield compensation (increased productivity in response to stem injuries) in barley exposed to C. cinctus. We examined these traits in eight barley cultivars. Antixenosis was assessed by counting number of eggs per stem and antibiosis was assessed by counting infested stems, dead larvae, and stems cut by mature larvae. Potential yield compensation was evaluated by comparing grain yield from three categories of stem infestation: 1) uninfested, 2) infested with dead larva, and 3) infested cut by mature larva at crop maturity. We found the greatest number of eggs per infested stem (1.80 ± 0.04), the highest proportion of infested stems (0.63 ± 0.01), and the highest proportion of cut stems (0.33 ± 0.01) in 'Hockett'. Seven out of eight cultivars had greater grain weight for infested stems than for uninfested stems. These cultivars may have compensatory responses to larval feeding injury. Overall, these barley cultivars contain varying levels of antixenosis, antibiosis, and differing levels of yield compensation. Our results provide foundational knowledge on barley traits that will provide a framework to further develop C. cinctus resistant or tolerant barley cultivars.},

   abstract = {Host plant traits can play a significant role in influencing the importance, direction and intensity of tri-trophic interactions by both direct and indirect pathways. A major goal in applied tri-trophic research has been to determine whether breeding for host plant resistance traits can be combined with biological control to develop a more comprehensive control strategy. An important component of developing such a strategy is understanding how host resistance traits affect natural enemy-prey interactions for important pest insects. Here we examine the influence of genotypic variation in stem solidity, the primary trait conferring resistance against the wheat stem sawfly, . Cephus cinctus, on parasitism of this major pest of wheat by its native braconid parasitoids. To do so, we conducted a field experiment in which we established replicate plots of 23 wheat genotypes that varied in levels of stem solidity, and quantified herbivore abundance and levels of parasitism across three sites in two years. Increasing stem solidity was associated with an approximately four-fold reduction in average parasitism rates, both across experimental plots and across wheat genotypes. Our analyses suggest that these effects were primarily direct, rather than indirectly mediated via effects of stem solidity on herbivore infestation levels or density. Interestingly, wheat genotype also had a significant influence on levels of parasitism, independent of its effects on stem solidity. Overall, our results suggest that although increasing stem solidity generally reduces parasitism, significant genotypic variability in average parasitism levels exist within solidity categories. Thus it may be possible to select resistant solid stemmed genotypes that also maintain relatively high parasitism levels. To our knowledge, our study is among the first to demonstrate a strong direct effect of genotypic variation in stem solidity on parasitism of grass mining insects, with important applied implications. © 2012 .},

Two fungi ( Beauveria bassiana  and  Metarhizium brunneum ), four nematodes species ( Steinernema carpocapsae ,  Steinernema kraussei ,  Steinernema feltiae , and  Heterorthabditis bacteriophora ),   an insect growth regulator (diflubenzuron/dimilin), and a botanical-based chemical (azadirachtin/Aza-direct) were used as foliar sprays. These control agents significantly reduced damage caused by  C. cinctus  larvae, compared to the untreated control or treatment with water alone. No yield differences were observed among entomopathogenic fungi, nematodes, and low risk insecticides. The effectiveness of azadirachtin, diflubenzuron, the entomopathogenic fungi, and the nematodes persisted at the 28 th  day post application, by which time the wheat had been harvested. Stubbles collected after harvest showed significantly fewer sawfly larvae in the plots treated with entomopathogenic fungi, nematodes, diflubenzuron, and azadirachtin compared to the untreated and water spray plots, indicating that these biorational pesticides have potential to be used as alternatives to conventional pesticides for controlling the wheat stem sawfly larvae.},

The role of aphid infestation level and duration, systemic production of volatiles by “insect-free” parts of the plant, and the specificity of aphid-induced volatiles on the flight behavior of the foraging female parasitoids were investigated. The upper insect-free part of a three-leaved broad bean plant, which was basally infested by a population of 40 A. pisum, released synomones detectable by A. ervi females after at least 48–72 hr of infestation, resulting in both significant increases in oriented flights and landings on the source compared with uninfested control plants. This suggests that volatiles involved in host-location by A. ervi are systemically released by broad bean plants either in response to circulation of aphid saliva, circulation of saliva-induced bioactive elicitors, or circulation of the synomones themselves. Air entrainment extracts of volatiles collected from a broad bean plant infested by the nonhost Aphis fabae or an uninfested broad bean plant elicited few oriented flights and landing responses by female parasitoids. These extracts were significantly less attractive than extracts collected from a broad bean plant infested by the host A. pisum, indicating the specificity of synomones elicited by different aphid species on the same plant species.},

They are emitted by one individual and cause a response in another. Most invertebrates rely on olfaction as the principal sensory modality for sensing their external environment. Attraction of insects to plants and other host organisms involves detection of specific semiochemicals or specific ratios of semiochemicals. Avoidance of unsuitable hosts can involve the detection of specific semiochemicals, or mixtures of semiochemicals, associated with non-host taxa. For integrated pest management, there is an opportunity to develop non-toxic interventions using semiochemicals that influence the behaviour of pest insects. Attractants can be used in baited traps to monitor pest populations. Furthermore, semiochemicals that repel pests or attract their natural enemies could be used to keep pest populations below damaging levels.},

   abstract = {Chemical ecology of the Insecta comprises an invisible environment where semiochemicals are the principal factors regulating the mating and host-selection of the one million or more species. Biologically effective concentrations of these semiochemicals range from 10−10 to 10−3 μg at the insect antennal receptors. These levels are virtually undetectable by conventional microchemistry, and can be measured only by behavioral bioassay and by electrophysiology which are about 10,000 and 100-fold more sensitive than gas chromatography. Despite more than 40 years of study, the sex pheromones have been identified from only about 1300 species of insects (0.1%). The dearth of information about kairomones from host plants for phytophagous insects is even more astonishing, and only about 400 plant species have been studied extensively (ca. 0.2%), and the odorant spectra characterized in only 10 important crop plants. These odorants are chemically complex and their action as semiochemicals for insect herbivores, involves degrees of receptor specificity and synergism that are virtually unstudied. These lacunae in our knowledge of chemical ecology are fundamental to the study of ecology, behavior, and evolution of insects; but also are of vital importance in applied entomology. There is much societal pressure to progress from broadcast application of insecticides, to specific and innovative methods for insect control that are non-hazardous to human health and to environmental quality. Pest management strategies involving the use of semiochemicals are essential to reach this goal. These include monitoring insect populations vis-a-vis the economic threshold, the use of attracticide baits, and strategies for mating confusion and behavioral confusion of insect pest populations in row and orchard crops. The immensity of the semiochemical environments of plant and insect communities, the intellectual challenges for understanding ecology and evolution, and the immediate need for application to applied entomology provide compelling reasons for enhanced study of the microchemistry of semiochemicals.},

   abstract = {Over relatively long distances, the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis is able to detect volatiles produced by bean plants that are infested by its prey, Tetranychus urticae, the twospotted spider mite. Our investigation examined the separate and combined effects of prey, their products, and prey-induced plant volatiles on when P. persimilis left a potential prey host plant. In wind tunnels, we assessed the relative importance of and interaction among local and distant prey-related cues. The examination of local cues included: (1) all local cues (prey eggs, webbing, and prey-induced plant volatiles), (2) food (prey eggs) and webbing only, (3) plant volatiles only, and (4) no prey-related cues. The examination of distant cues involved the presence or absence of prey-induced plant volatiles from upwind plants. External volatile cues, produced by placing prey-infested plants upwind in the wind tunnel, resulted in more predators leaving downwind plants, and leaving sooner, than when clean plants were upwind, regardless of the availability of prey or prey-related cues on the local plant. However, local cues, especially the presence of food/webbing, had a greater effect than distant cues on timing of predator leaving. Predators remained in larger numbers and for longer times on prey-infested plants. However, the presence of either locally-produced plant volatiles or food/webbing alone still reduced the number of predators leaving a plant in the first hour compared to clean plants. After the first hour, the number of predators leaving was primarily driven by the presence of food/webbing. When no food/webbing was available, predators left plants rapidly; if food/webbing was available, some predatory mites remained on plants at least 24 hours. Even if no food/webbing was available, predators presented with local volatiles remained on plants for several hours longer than on clean plants without local volatiles. These small changes in leaving rates may lead to differences in local population dynamics, and possibly regional persistence, of the predator-prey interaction in patchy environments.},

   abstract = {The egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) responded to synomones emitted by leguminous plants induced by feeding and oviposition activity of the bug Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). This was shown by laboratory bioassays using a Y-tube olfactometer. Broad bean leaves (Vicia faba L.) damaged by feeding activity of N. viridula and on which host egg mass had been laid produced synomones that attracted T. basalis. By contrast, undamaged leaves or feeding-damaged leaves without eggs did not attract wasp females. French bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) also emitted attractive synomones when they were damaged by host feeding and carrying egg masses. Thus, release of feeding- and oviposition-induced synomones does not seem to be plant-specific. Synomone production was shown to be a systemically induced plant physiological response to feeding damage and opposition. Also, parts of the plant that were left undamaged and did not carry host eggs emitted attractive synomones when other parts of the plant were damaged by feeding and carrying eggs. Furthermore, wasps were not attracted by N. viridula egg masses offered alone or combined with damaged broad bean leaves. Thus, the attractiveness of feeding-damaged leaves carrying eggs is due to induction by feeding and opposition rather than due to a combined effect of attractive volatiles released from eggs and damaged leaves. The production of synomones was influenced by the age of the host egg mass, because feeding-damaged leaves bearing egg masses attracted the parasitoid until the eggs were ∼72-96 h old but not once the larvae had hatched from the eggs (∼120 h old). These results show that annual plants are able to produce synomones as a consequence of feeding and egg mass oviposition by a sucking insect.},

However, understanding how the climatic water balance and complex topography contribute to these processes from hillslope to catchment scales remains difficult. We compared time series of vapor pressure deficits and soil moisture to the climatic water balance and topographic variables across six zero-order catchments in the Lubrecht Experimental Forest (Montana, USA). We then evaluated how local hydrometeorology (volumetric water content and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit) affected the spatial occurrence of shallow subsurface flow. Generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed significant, temporally stable (monthly and seasonal average) patterns of hydrometeorology that can be predicted by the topographic wetness index and the dynamic climatic water deficit (CWD = potential evapotranspiration − actual evapotranspiration). Intracatchment patterns were significantly correlated to the topographic wetness index, while intercatchment patterns were correlated to spatiotemporal variance in the CWD during each time period. Spatial patterns of shallow subsurface flow were related to the hydrometeorological conditions of the site. We observed persistent shallow subsurface flow in convergent hillslope positions, except when a catchment was positioned in locations with high CWDs (low elevations and southerly aspects). Alternatively, we observed persistent subsurface flow across all hillslope positions (even 70-m upslope from the hollow) when catchments were positioned in locations with especially low CWDs (northerly aspects and high elevations). These results highlight the importance of considering the superposition of the catchment-scale climatic water balance and hillslope-scale topography when characterizing hydrometeorology and shallow subsurface flow dynamics.},

   abstract = {Vegetational diversity within agricultural ®elds is often suggested as a means to reduce insect herbivore populations and to increase their natural enemies. In this paper we compare population densities of herbivores, predators, and parasitoids on collards in monocultures and on collards interplanted with two dierent groups of weeds, one with weed species from the same plant family as the collards (Brassicaceae) and one with weed species from unrelated plant families (non-Brassicaceae). The collards in the Brassicaceae weed polyculture had higher densities (number of herbivores/mean leaf area (cm 2) per plant) of specialist herbivores than collards in the non-Brassicaceae weed polyculture and in collard monoculture. Thè`resource concentration'' hypothesis is supported by the observation of higher populations of Phyllotreta spp., acting as facultative polyphages, in the Brassicaceae weed polyculture than in the non-Brass-icaceae weed polyculture where Phyllotreta spp. are facultative monophages. Population densities of natural enemies (mostly coccinellids, carabids, and staphylinids) were higher in the polycultures than in the monoculture: carabid and staphylinid predators may be responsible for larval mortality in the imported cabbage worm, Pieris rapae, and in the diamondback larvae, Plutella xylostella. In spite of dierences in densities of specialist herbivores across treatments, crop yield, leaf area (cm 2), the proportion of leaf area damaged, and the number of leaves undamaged did not dier. These ®ndings suggest that plant competition may interfere with attempts to reduce herbivore damage. We conclude that the use of weedy cultures can provide eective means of reducing herbivores if the crop and weed species are not related and plant competition is prevented.},

   abstract = {Understanding how and why insect numbers ßuctuate through time and space has been a central theme in ecological research for more than a century. Life tables have been used to understand temporal and spatial patterns in insect numbers. In this study, we estimated cause-of-death probabilities for phytophagous insects using multiple decrement life tables and the irreplaceable mortality analytic technique. Multiple decrement life tables were created from 73 insect life tables published from 1954 to 2004. Irreplaceable mortality (the portion of mortality that cannot be replaced by another cause) from pathogens, predators, and parasitoids was 8.6 7.2, 7.8 4.9, and 6.2 1.6%, respectively. In contrast, the mean irreplaceable mortality from all non-natural enemy mortality factors (mortality from factors other than natural enemies) was 35.1 4.4%. Irreplaceable mortality from natural enemies was signiÞcantly lower compared with non-natural enemy factors. Our results may partially explain cases of unsuccessful efÞcacy in classical biological control, after successful establishment, by showing low irreplaceable mortality for natural enemies, including 5.2 1.6% for introduced natural enemies. We suggest that the environment (i.e., the degree of environmental stability) inßuences the magnitude of the irreplaceable mortality from natural enemies. Our results lead to several testable hypotheses and emphasize that it is not possible to estimate the effect of any mortality factor without considering its interaction with competing mortality factors, which has far-reaching consequences for population biology and applied ecology.

It has been hypothesized that this observation reflects selection resulting from shifts in floral composition under climate change. Here we used morphometrics and population genomics to determine whether morphological change is ongoing, investigate the genetic basis of morphological variation, and analyse population structure in these populations. We generated a genome assembly of B. balteatus. We then analysed whole-genome sequencing data and morphometric measurements of 580 samples of both species from seven high-altitude localities. Out of 281 samples originally identified as B. sylvicola, 67 formed a separate genetic cluster comprising a newly-discovered cryptic species (“incognitus”). However, an absence of genetic structure within species suggests that gene flow is common between mountains. We found a significant decrease in tongue length between bees collected between 2012–2014 and in 2017, indicating that morphological shifts are ongoing. We did not discover any genetic associations with tongue length, but a SNP related to production of a proteolytic digestive enzyme was implicated in body size variation. We identified evidence of covariance between kinship and both tongue length and body size, which is suggestive of a genetic component of these traits, although it is possible that shared environmental effects between colonies are responsible. Our results provide evidence for ongoing modification of a morphological trait important for pollination and indicate that this trait probably has a complex genetic and environmental basis.},

The composition of the released VOC blend is dependent on the physiological status and, consequently, is affected by biotic and abiotic stresses.

Here, the responses of tomato plants (emitters) to single or combined abiotic (water stress) and biotic (aphid attack) stresses, and the effect of VOC released by emitters on neighboring unstressed plants (receivers), have been investigated. Emissions of α-pinene and methyl salicylate from plants exposed to single or combined stress, and of camphene from plants exposed to water or combined stress were significantly higher than in unstressed plants. In receivers, only the release of methyl salicylate increased when companion emitters were stressed. The expression of genes related to VOC biosynthesis and plant defense responses was unaffected or declined in water-stressed emitters, and was generally higher in receivers than in emitters. The gene coding for methyl salicylate biosynthesis was particularly active in aphid-attacked emitters and in receivers that were conditioned by the infested emitters. In addition, VOCs emitted by stressed plants induce VOC emission in unstressed receivers, and this increases attraction of parasitic wasps, which may improve protection against aphid attacks under conditions of reduced water availability.},

Cities produce many conditions that are predicted to occur widely in the future, such as warmer temperatures, higher carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and exacerbated droughts. In using cities as surrogates for global change, it is challenging to disentangle climate variables—such as temperature—from co-occurring or confounding urban variables—such as impervious surface—and then to understand the interactive effects of multiple climate variables on both individual species and species interactions. However, such interactions are also difficult to replicate experimentally, and thus the challenges of cities are also their unique advantage. Here, we review insights gained from cities, with a focus on plants and arthropods, and how urban findings agree or disagree with experimental predictions and historical data. We discuss the types of hypotheses that can be best tested in cities, caveats to urban research and how to further validate cities as surrogates for global change. Lastly, we summarize how to achieve the goal of using urban species responses to predict broader regional- and ecosystem-level patterns in the future.},

   abstract = {When maize plants, Zea mays L., are mechanically damaged and the damaged sites are treated with caterpillar regurgitant, the plants will release a specific blend of volatiles. It is known that these volatiles can be attractive to natural enemies of herbivores. We hypothesise that the plant volatiles constitute part of the induced plant defence and that herbivores will be affected by the odours as well. In laboratory and semi-field studies this hypothesis was tested for the aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) (Rhynchota, Sternorrhyncha, Aphididae). In a Y-tube olfactometer significantly more aphids chose the odour of healthy, undamaged maize seedlings when tested against clean air or plants treated with regurgitant. Clean air was chosen more often when tested next to the odour of treated plants. This apparently repellent effect of the odour of treated plants was significant for winged aphids, but not for the wingless aphids. In field experiments aphids were released in the centre of circles of eight potted maize plants. Four plants in each circle were damaged and treated with caterpillar regurgitant while the other plants were left unharmed. At different intervals after aphid release, the number of aphids was counted on each plant. Significantly fewer winged and wingless aphids were found back on treated plants than on healthy plants. We suggest that herbivores may be repelled by the odours because they could indicate that: 1) the plant has initiated the production of toxic compounds; 2) potential competitors are present on the plant; 3) the plant is attractive to parasitoids and predators. Aphids may be particularly sensitive to induced maize volatiles because one of the major compounds emitted by the plant is (E)-β-farnesene, which is a common alarm pheromone for aphids. Collections and analyses of the odours emitted by crushed R. maidis confirmed that it too emits (E)-β-farnesene when stressed. The results are discussed in context of plant defence strategies and their possible exploitation for the control of pest insects.},

The second introduction received on an exchange basis from the same U.S.S.R. experiment station in 1906 was planted and increased at experiment stations in Newell, S.D., and Mandan, N.D. These increases were responsible for the early distribution and establishment of crested wheatgrass in the United States. The cultivar Fairway distributed in Canada from the University of Saskatchewan in the late 1920's came from one of the accessions of the second introduction first planted at Newell, S.D. Crested wheatgrass has become the most successful and the most widely used introduced grass in the semiard and arid region of western United States.},

Despite the high economic importance, phylogenetic relationships of rye species have not been fully determined, and they are extremely important for the process of breeding of new cultivars that can be enriched with functional traits derived from wild rye species. The study analyzed the degree of relationship of 35 accessions of the genus Secale, representing 13 most often distinguished species and subspecies, originating from various seed collections in the world, based on the analysis of noncoding regions of the chloroplast (cpDNA) and mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), widely used in phylogenetic and population plant studies, because of a higher rate of evolution than the coding regions. There was no clear genetic structure between different species and subspecies, which may indicated the introgression between these taxa. The obtained data confirmed that S. vavilovii was very similar to S. cereale, which confirmed the assumption that they might share a common ancestor. The results also confirmed the divergence of S. sylvestre from other species and subspecies of rye. Areas that may be useful molecular markers in studies on closely related species of the genus Secale were also indicated.},

This is usually interpreted in terms of Fisher's fundamental theorem to mean that populations are near evolutionary equilibrium and genetic variance in total fitness is low. We develop the causal relationship between metric traits and life-history traits to show that a life-history trait is expected to have a low heritability whether or not the population is at equilibrium. This is because it is subject to all the environmental variation in the metric traits that affect it plus additional environmental variation. There is no simple prediction regarding levels ofadditive genetic variance in life-history traits, which may be high at equilibrium. Several other patterns in the inheritance of life-history traits are readily predicted from the causal model. These include the strength ofgenetic correlations between life-history traits, levels ofnonadditive genetic variance, and the inevitability ofgenotype-environment interaction.},

Research into this area has been rapidly expanding, but knowledge gaps still exist. We conducted a review of the literature to provide a synthesis of extreme climate events on insects and identify future areas of research. In our review, we asked the following questions: 1) What are the direct and indirect mechanisms that extreme climate events affect individual insects? 2) What are the effects of extreme climate events on insect populations and demography? 3) What are the implications of the extreme climate events effects on insect communities? Drought was among the most frequently described type of extreme climate event affecting insects, as well as the effects of temperature extremes and extreme temperature variation. Our review explores the factors that determine the sensitivity or resilience to climate extremes for individuals, populations, and communities. We also identify areas of future research to better understand the role of extreme climate events on insects including effects on non-trophic interactions, alteration of population dynamics, and mediation of the functional the trait set of communities. Many insect species are under threat from global change and extreme climate events are a contributing factor. Biologists and policy makers should consider the role of extreme events in their work to mitigate the loss of biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services by insects.},

   abstract = {Habitat fragmentation can significantly affect plant reproductive success and ultimately population viability, but little is known about the magnitude, direction or time scale of these impacts on plant-pollinator mutualisms. In this study, four species of terrestrial orchid with specialist and generalist pollination syndromes were used to investigate the effects of fragmentation on capsule set in urban bushland remnants. Supplementary pollination showed pollination limitation, but not resource limitation, occurs across all species. Habitat and landscape scale fragmentation predictor variables were used to build parsimonious models that explained capsule set data collected over 2. years. We found the sexually deceptive species, Caladenia arenicola, to be sensitive to interactions between landscape (perimeter to area ratio) and habitat scale (bare ground cover and population size) predictor variables. The effect of perimeter to area ratio was heavily tempered by the significant negative influence of bare ground cover, where values of over 40% bare ground cover resulted in reproductive failure. We found that generalist pollinated species had significant interactions at the habitat scale including significant positive interactions between capsule set and population size and litter cover. Our results suggest the effects of habitat fragmentation at the landscape and habitat scale are important drivers of population viability. Our results suggest population viability will depend on the sensitivity of the pollination syndrome and the pollinator involved.

However, there is little information on the most suitable rearing conditions for growth, development and survivorship of these flies, which is a prerequisite for mass production technologies. We evaluated the physiological requirements for growth and reproduction of H. illucens on two diets [spent grains supplemented with brewers' yeast (D1) and un-supplemented (D2)]. Development rates at nine constant temperatures (10-42°C) were fitted to temperature-dependent linear and non-linear day-degree models. Thereafter, life history table parameters were determined within a range of favourable temperatures. The thermal maximum (TM) estimates for larval, pre-pupal and pupal development using non-linear model ranged between 37.2 ± 0.3 and 44.0 ± 2.3°C. The non-linear and linear day-degree model estimations of lower developmental temperature threshold for larvae were 11.7 ± 0.9 and 12.3 ± 1.4°C for D1, and 10.4 ± 1.7 and 11.7 ± 3.0°C for D2, respectively. The estimated thermal constant of immature life stages development of BSF was higher for the larval stage (250±25 DD for D1 and 333±51 for D2) than the other stages evaluated. Final larval wet weight was higher on D1 compared to D2. The population growth rate was most favourable at 30-degree celsius (°C) with higher intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm = 0.127 for D1 and 0.122 for D2) and shorter doubling time (5.5 days for D1 and 5.7 days for D2) compared to the other temperatures. These results are valuable for the optimization of commercial mass rearing procedures of BSF under various environmental conditions and prediction of population dynamics patterns using computer simulation models.},

Although additional research is needed, the current state of the technology for utilizing the black soldier fly (Hermatia) for processing hen and swine manure appears to make it commercially feasible. Hermetia consume manure and convert the nutrients into larval insect mass, which contains 40+% protein and 30+% fat; thus a potential high protein, high energy animal feed. In the process, manure mass is reduced about 50%, with even greater reductions in N and P mass. Additional environmental benefits occur, and a recent analysis suggests that Hermetia manure management could increase net revenue by $25,000! per year per layer house. For all applications, needed improved technology is associated with the adult life cycle and providing eggs throughout the year, and providing a warm environment for the larvae during winter. For conventional swine barn applications, economical methods for removal of excess liquid (urine) are also needed.},

   abstract = {While the importance of floral odours for pollinator attraction relative to visual cues is increasingly appreciated, how they structure community-level plant–pollinator interactions is poorly understood. Elucidating the functional roles of flowering plant species with respect to their floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and how those roles vary over the growing season is an initial step towards understanding the contribution of floral VOCs to plant–pollinator interaction structure. We sampled the floral VOCs, phenologies and bee visitors of naturally growing plants in a montane meadow in the Northern Rocky Mountains of USA in order to acquire a base understanding of how floral VOCs and other plant traits may structure plant–pollinator interactions across the growing season. We expected forb species with floral VOCs that were original (far from the community mean) and unique (far from the nearest neighbour) would have few pollinating partners (i.e. specialists), while forbs with non-original or highly variable floral VOCs would form the generalist core of interactors, thereby contributing to network nestedness (specialists interacting with nested subsets of generalists). Network modularity (patterns of distinct, highly connected subnetworks) could be influenced by groups of pollinators that are attracted to or repelled by certain floral bouquets. Species blooming in early spring emitted similar floral VOC blends containing generalist attractants, whereas floral VOC complexity was highest in mid to late summer. Forb species varied in the originality, uniqueness, and intraspecific variation (i.e. dispersion) of their floral VOCs, indicating the potential for different functional roles in plant–pollinator networks. Specifically, the originality, uniqueness and dispersion of forb species’ floral VOCs increased across the growing season. Floral VOCs influenced forb interactions with pollinators. Floral VOCs contributed to the nested structure, but not modular structure, of community-level plant–pollinator network structure. Forb species with more original floral VOCs were less connected, while forb species emitting more compounds and with higher intraspecific variation in floral VOCs were more connected to pollinators. These findings show that floral scent plays important roles in structuring bee–forb interactions and guiding seasonal patterns in complex communities. Understanding seasonal patterns in floral VOCs may have important implications for plant–pollinator interactions among communities differing in species composition, or as shifts occur in suites of co-flowering species due to climate change.

Non-host feeding adults of these braconids increase longevity, egg load, and egg volume when provisioned carbohydrate-rich diets. Nutrition from nectar can enhance the success of natural enemies in pest management programs. Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walpers, is a potential cover-crop that could add resilient features to the landscape and has extrafloral nectaries (EFN), easy-access nectar sources for beneficial insects. If more cowpea was grown on the Northern Great Plains, would B. cephi and B. lissogaster benefit from foraging on putatively beneficial EFN? We investigated cowpea inflorescence stalk extrafloral nectars (IS-EFN) and leaf stipel extrafloral nectars (LS-EFN) as potential food sources for these parasitoids. Females were caged on EFN sources on living cowpea plants to assess longevity. Egg load and volume were measured at 2, 5, and 10 days after placement. Bracon cephi survived 10 days on water, 38 days on IS-EFN; B. lissogaster 6 days on water, 28 days on IS-EFN. Bracon lissogaster maintained a constant egg load and volume across treatments while B. cephi produced 2.1-fold more eggs that were 1.6-fold larger on IS-EFN. Y-tube olfactometry indicated adult females were attracted to airstreams containing cowpea volatiles. These results demonstrate that non-native, warm-season cowpea benefits these native parasitoids and may improve conservation biocontrol of C. cinctus.</p>},

This grass acts as a dead-end trap crop because it is the preferred plant for oviposition relative to sugarcane, and it precludes larval development. We explored the chemical mechanisms involved in host choice by C. sacchariphagus. We showed that the insect's antennal receptors are particularly sensitive to the shared compounds found in the volatile emissions produced by sugarcane and E. arundinaceus. In accordance with their phylogenetic proximity, the two plant species share many physicochemical properties, which suggests that C. sacchariphagus has few sensory cues to differentiate between the two. The terpene (E)-β-ocimene is constitutively emitted by E. arundinaceus, but not by sugarcane. It elicits an electroantennographic response and behavioral responses from female C. sacchariphagus in Y-tube bioassays. Our study suggests that the sensory confusion between host plants, combined with a marginal sensory difference orienting the choice of an egg-laying site, constitutes a mechanism that is relevant to trap cropping. Systems based on this type of mechanism could provide long-term protection for crops vulnerable to insect pests.},

We found that floral margins significantly benefit the natural enemy community and biological control services, relative to non-floral grass margins. We confirm that field margin type is linked to higher abundance and diversity of natural enemies, lower numbers of herbivorous invertebrate pests, and reduced crop damage. We consider whether specific characterisations of natural enemies and pest communities vary between these margin types, finding key differences in the abundances of aerial and epigeal enemies, the diversity of parasitoid and predatory enemies and pest abundances found in naturally regenerating and sown floral field margins. The finding here cements the implementation of floral field margins as a legitimate control method for crop pests in the face of losses due to pesticides and highlights design and management considerations for the success of floral margins.},

Cephus cinctus has a wide host range, attacking numerous wild grasses and cultivated cereals in crop and grassland habitats, where it is, in turn, attacked by 2 native braconid parasitoids. Quantitative assessments of C. cinctus infestation and parasitism levels in different grass species across the full spectrum of available hosts are important in assessing the extent to which grasslands, or specific constituent grass species, may be reservoirs of pests or parasitoids moving into wheat. We quantified infestation and parasitism levels in over 25,000 stems collected from 17 grass species and wheat spanning 35 sites in central Montana, United States, over 2 yr. Infestation levels in 5 grass species, primarily wheatgrasses, were high (38%–65%) and similar to the levels observed in wheat (55%). In contrast, the majority of grass species (12 of 17) had significantly lower levels of infestation (&amp;lt;10%), suggesting that most grasses are not important reservoirs of C. cinctus. Parasitism levels in highly infested wheatgrasses were, on average, 3 times higher than those in cultivated wheat, suggesting that these grasses could provide important conservation habitat for parasitoids. Future work examining the relative performance of pests and parasitoids in these grasses will be important in gauging their relative value as plant materials to bolster parasitoid conservation in reseeded grassland habitats.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus Norton, is a major pest of common bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cultivated cereals in North America. Planting of cultivars with solid stems has been the primary management strategy to prevent yield loss due to WSS infestation, however expression of this phenotype can vary depending on environmental conditions and solid stems hinder biological control of WSS via braconid parasitoids Bracon cephi (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck. In the hollow stems of oat (Avena sativa L.), WSS larvae experience 100% mortality before they reach late instars, but the mechanisms for this observed resistance have not been characterized. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore additional sources of resistance outside of the historic solid stem phenotype. Methods: Here, we use an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the response of the metabolome of two cultivars of oat and four cultivars of spring wheat to infestation by WSS. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), differentially expressed metabolites were identified between oat and wheat which were associated with the phenylpropanoid pathway, phospholipid biosynthesis and signaling, the salicylic acid signaling pathway, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) degradation, and biosynthesis of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones (Bxs). Several phospho- and galacto- lipids were found in higher abundance in oat, and with the exception of early stem solidness cultivar Conan, both species experienced a decrease in abundance once infested. In all wheat cultivars except Conan, an increase in abundance was observed for Bxs HMDBOA-glc and DIBOA-β-D-glucoside after infestation, indicating that this pathway is involved in wheat response to infestation in both solid and hollow stemmed cultivars. Differences between species in compounds involved in IAA biosynthesis, degradation and inactivation suggest that wheat may respond to infestation by inactivating IAA or altering the IAA pool in stem tissue. Conclusion: We propose that the species differences found here likely affect the survival of WSS larvae and may also be associated with differences in stem architecture at the molecular level. Our findings suggest pathways to focus on for future studies in elucidating plant response to WSS infestation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-tool approaches often fail to provide effective long-term suppression of pest populations, such that combining several tools into an integrated management strategy is critical. Yet studies that harness the power of population models to explore the relative efficacy of various management tools and their combinations remain rare. We constructed a Leslie matrix population model to evaluate the potential of crop resistance, acting alone or in combination with biological control, to reduce populations of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, a major pest of wheat in North America. RESULTS: Our model projections indicated that crop resistance reduced, but did not stop, C. cinctus population growth, suggesting that implementing multiple management tools will be necessary for longer term control of this pest. The levels of parasitism needed to curtail population growth were much lower in model projections for resistant solid-stemmed compared with susceptible hollow-stemmed cultivars (22% versus 86%). Furthermore, even when accounting for the reduced levels of parasitism observed in resistant cultivars, projected population growth rates for C. cinctus were always lower in resistant compared with susceptible wheat cultivars. CONCLUSION: Despite some empirical evidence for antagonistic interactions between resistance and biological control, our models suggest that combining these two approaches will always reduce population growth rates to lower levels than implementing either strategy alone. More work focused on integrating biological control into crop resistance breeding programs, and determining how these approaches affect performance of limiting life stages, will be important to optimize sustainable approaches to integrated pest management in this system and more broadly.

   abstract = {Several agroecological and integrated pest management strategies focus on landscape management to increase complexity and foster biodiversity. However, landscape complexity does not always enhance biological control and in some cases may lead to increased pest populations. We examined the prevalence of two Bracon parasitoids, Bracon cephi Gahan and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), and their host the wheat stem sawfly Cephus cinctus Norton, a major pest of wheat. We assessed the degree of noncrop and crop host plant use and responses to landscape composition. We found no instances of parasitism by either Bracon species in our three-year, statewide winter wheat survey but found small populations of Bracon in noncrop landscapes throughout eastern and western Colorado. We used model selection to examine how local (500 m scale) and landscape (5 km scale) cover of suitable noncrop and crop habitats potentially affects abundances of Bracon and wheat stem sawfly. Our best fit model for wheat stem sawfly suggests that a decrease in noncrop cover at the landscape scale leads to an increase in wheat stem sawfly infestation. Our best fit model for Bracon parasitism suggests an increase in wheat cover at the local level results in the greatest increase in the odds of parasitism by either species of Bracon. Herbaceous cover at local and landscape scales were also significant predictors of Bracon parasitism. The results of this study suggest that pest and natural enemies respond differently to landscape composition and these responses should be evaluated before management decisions are made.},

The study took place at the Centro Estadual de Diagnóstico e Pesquisa Florestal, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.

We recorded the number and biomass of marketable leaves from three harvests. A total of 618 arthropods were collected from plants along the periphery: Insecta (589), Arachnida (20), and Entognatha (9). Hemiptera was the most prevalent order (49.84%). Kale plants near the periphery experienced less predation from leaf beetles. Plants along the periphery hosted important predator groups as well as phytophages that can serve as alternative prey. Diversifying the periphery with fennel, fava bean, and marigolds shows promise as a strategy to enhance the arthropod community in kale cultivation, thereby acting as a conservative biological control.},

   abstract = {Annual cropping systems consist of a shifting mosaic of habitats that vary through time in their availability and suitability to insect pests. Agroecosystem instability results from changes that occur within a season with crop planting, development, and harvest. Further instability results from continuous alterations in biotic and abiotic insect life system components and from agricultural inputs. Changes to agroecosystems occur across seasons with changing agricultural practices, changing cropping patterns, and technological innovations. Much of this instability is a result of events unconnected with pest management.

The abilities of polyphagous pest species to move among and utilize different habitat patches in response to changes in suitability enable the pests to exploit unstable cropping systems. These pest characteristics determine the location and timing of damaging populations. Habitat suitability is influenced by plant species and cultivar, crop phenology, and agricultural inputs. Pest movement is affected by a suite of intrinsic factors, such as population age structure and mobility, and extrinsic factors, including weather systems and habitat distribution.

The life systems of three selected polyphagous pests are presented to demonstrate how an understanding of such systems in agricultural ecosystems improves our ability to predict and hence manage these populations.},

While syntheses under more benign conditions have been demonstrated, the resulting material performance is often not competitive. Herein, we demonstrate the controlled, aqueous phase, and ambient temperature biomineralization-based synthesis of nanocrystalline CdS/ZnS core/shell hydrogen evolution photocatalysts using a purified form of the enzyme, cystathionine γ-lyase. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution measurements show that controlled Zn2+-based passivation of the surface of CdS improves the hydrogen evolution activity from 1300 μmol h-1g-1to 3200 μmol h-1g-1in the presence of a Na2S/Na2SO3sacrificial reagent, which is on par with reported hydrogen evolution rates of CdS/ZnS core/shell photocatalysts synthesized through traditional chemical routes. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity and PL lifetime measurements coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicate that Zn2+passivates the surface of biomineralized CdS nanocrystals, with the extent of passivation controlled by the concentration of the zinc precursor added directly to the synthesis solution. Photodeposition of a platinum cocatalyst onto the highest-performing CdS/ZnS photocatalyst further boosts the hydrogen evolution rate to 7200 μmol h-1g-1in the presence of a Na2S/Na2SO3sacrificial reagent, establishing biomineralization as an effective platform for the controlled synthesis of high-performing heterojunction hydrogen evolution photocatalysts.},

In these microcosms, ladybeetle larvae foraged singly or as conspecific or heterospecific pairs, for pea aphids on bean plants over a two-day period. Similarly sized third instar larvae of Hippodamia convergens and H. tredecimpunc-tara, H. convergens and H. sinuata, and H. convergens and Coccinella septempunctata, were tested in experiments designed to ensure that paired larvae experienced moderate competition. Interspecific competition in these experiments did not differ significantly from intraspecific competition, in that an individual's weight gain did not depend on whether its competitor was heterospecific or conspecific. Furthermore, aphid populations were reduced equally by heterospecific and conspecific pairs. These results suggest that there is little or no difference between intra and interspecific interactions among larvae of these ladybeetles when two similarly sized individuals co-occur on a host plant. Thus, the species diversity per se of assemblages of ladybeetle larvae may have little influence over the short term on the reduction of aphid populations by ladybeetle predation.},

This tenet, restated as a hypothesis, is rejected based on moose population response to a chronic wolf decline. In 1980-1996 with wolf numbers down, partly due to introduced disease, moose numbers increased to a historic high level. There was insufficient density dependence in moose reproduction and mortality to stabilize moose numbers. In 1996 moose suffered a crash; 80% died, primarily from starvation. These fluctuations, along with the possibility that the highly inbred wolf population may become extinct, will challenge NPS policy. The long-standing NPS management tradition of nonintervention may not be compatible with the current policy that stresses maintenance of natural ecological processes, such as a predator-prey system.},

However, the influence of the landscape context and agricultural management on the capacity of these small green infrastructures to support diversity is poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the effect of landscape simplification, agricultural intensification in the neighbourhood, and quality of the floral habitats on the success of these patches to support flower-visiting insect communities as well as the pollination service they provide. To this aim, we sampled floral patches located in 18 paired olive farms with contrasting herb cover management (intensive vs. low-intensity), distributed along a wide gradient of landscape complexity at the regional scale of South Spain. We conducted surveys of flower-visiting insects in 36 multi-floral stands and 36 mono-floral stands of Sinapis alba Linnaeus (1753) within these floral patches. Mono-floral stands were used to evaluate variations in the pollination service through number of viable seeds and seed set. Results revealed that the abundance and diversity of flower-visiting insects respond to the quality of the floral patch (diversity of flowers) but not to landscape context nor agricultural management around it. Moreover, the pollination service was similar and high (seed set ca. 100 %) in all floral patches regardless of their context. Our findings highlight the importance of even small floral patches that function as reservoirs of diversity of flower-visiting insects and the pollination service. They also show the high resistance of these patches to agricultural intensification and simplification in olive grove landscapes.},

Ecologists and conservationists often appreciate the contribution of natural habitat to biodiversity and potential ecosystem services such as biological pest control, whereas many farmers see habitat remnants as a waste of cropland or source of pests. While natural habitat has been shown to increase pest control in many systems, we here identify five hypotheses for when and why natural habitat can fail to support biological pest control, and illustrate each with case studies from the literature: (1) pest populations have no effective natural enemies in the region, (2) natural habitat is a greater source of pests than natural enemies, (3) crops provide more resources for natural enemies than does natural habitat, (4) natural habitat is insufficient in amount, proximity, composition, or configuration to provide large enough enemy populations needed for pest control, and (5) agricultural practices counteract enemy establishment and biocontrol provided by natural habitat. In conclusion, we show that the relative importance of natural habitat for biocontrol can vary dramatically depending on type of crop, pest, predator, land management, and landscape structure. This variation needs to be considered when designing measures aimed at enhancing biocontrol services through restoring or maintaining natural habitat.},

In particular, variability and trends in temperature above or below ecologically and socially meaningful thresholds within this region (e.g., -17.8°C (0°F), 0°C (32°F), and 32.2°C (90°F)) are assessed. The daily temperature time series reveal extremely cold days (≤ -17.8°C) terminate on average 20 days earlier and decline in number, whereas extremely hot days (≥32°C) show a three-fold increase in number and a 24-day increase in seasonal window during which they occur. Results show that regionally important thresholds have been exceeded, the most recent of which include the timing and number of the 0°C freeze/thaw temperatures during spring and fall. Finally, we close with a discussion on the implications for Montana's ecosystems.

Here we analyze US winter wheat production from 1970 to 2017 and find that harvest area ratio (harvested area/planted area, HAR) has declined while yields have risen, standing in stark contrast to other US staple crops. Although lower profitability due to declining wheat prices appears to explain the HAR trend, fluctuating wheat yields—largely explained by temperature exposure—drive the interannual variation of HAR. Our analysis suggests that warming-induced declines in HAR are comparable in magnitude to heat-related yield losses, and lower wheat prices amplify the sensitivity of HAR to warming and yield variation. Although irrigation mitigates some temperature-driven yield effects, it does little to change HAR, likely due to infrastructure cost and limited influence on relative profitability. Our results suggest that an accurate quantification of climate impacts on crop production must account for harvested area response, and that future adaptation strategies should not only target crop choice and management but also harvest incentives.},

Bioclimatic simulation tools, such as Climex, predict the potential geographic distribution and establishment of insects in ecosystems, based on climate. The ecoclimatic index, a measure of ecological suitability, integrates potential population growth with stresses to produce estimates of relative abundance. This simulation software was used to develop a bioclimate model for C. cinctus in western Canada. Results fostered a better understanding of how C. cinctus responded to selected climate variables. Two general circulation models were then applied to assess the response of C. cinctus populations to future climate. Relative to current climate, predicted changes in C. cinctus distribution and relative abundance were greatest for 2030, with a small further increase for 2070. Across the Prairies and Boreal Plains Ecozones, changes in ecoclimatic index were greater than in geographic distribution.

   abstract = {Covering about 40% of Earth's land surface and sustaining at least 38% of global population, drylands are key crop and animal production regionswith high economic and social values. However, land use changes associated with industrialized agricultural managements are threatening the sustainability of these systems. While previous studies assessing the impacts of agricultural management systems on biodiversity and their services focused on more diversified mesic landscapes, there is a dearth of such research in highly simplified dryland agroecosystems. In this paper, we 1) summarize previous research on the effects of farm management systems and agricultural expansion on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services, 2) present four case studies assessing the impacts of management systems on biodiversity and ecosystem services across highly simplified dryland landscapes of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), USA, 3) discuss approaches to sustain biodiversity-based ecosystem services in drylands, and 4) present a conceptual framework for enhancing agricultural sustainability in the drylands through research, policy, economic valuation, and adaptivemanagement. An analysis of the land use changes due to agricultural expansion within the Golden Triangle, a representative agricultural area in the NGP, indicated that the proportion of land conversion to agriculture area was 84%, 8%, and 7% from grassland, riparian, and shrubland habitats, respectively. Our results showed this simplificationwas associatedwith a potential reduction of pollination services. Also, our economic analysis projected that if 30% parasitismcould be achieved through bettermanagement systems, the estimated potential economic returns to pest regulation services through parasitoids inMontana, USA alone could reach about $11.23 million. Overall, while dryland agroecosystems showed a significant loss of native biodiversity and its services, greater pest incidence, and a decrease in plant pollinator networks, these trends were moderately reversed in organically managed farming systems. In conclusion, although land use changes due to agricultural expansion and industrialized farming threaten the sustainability of dryland agroecosystems, this impact can be partially offset by coupling ecologically-based farming practices with adaptive management strategies.},

   abstract = {Many invasive and opportunistic pests cause multiple, interdependent adverse outcomes on agricultural production. Often, however, these impacts are modeled independently, which can bias empirical inferences and contribute to inaccurate recommendations. We use a copula function to more accurately model the joint behavior and provide an empirical example of its application to assess the impacts of the wheat stem sawfly (WSS). We use a unique farm-level dataset to estimate the expected losses associated with WSS and then evaluate two popular WSS management strategies. We find that strategies minimizing long-run infestation levels are preferred to those that seek to maximize yield potential in exchange for higher risk of intertemporal infestation.},

   abstract = {Wheat stem sawßy, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), oviposition patterns and larval development in downy brome grass, Bromus tectorum L., and wheat, Triticum aestivum L., were compared in a commercially grown wheat Þeld infested with downy brome grass in Montana. Seven weekly randomly selected samples of stems for each plant species were collected at points where both plants were growing together. The level of infestation in downy brome grass was almost twofold higher than for wheat throughout the growing season. Larval mortality was not detected in either plant species early in the season, but mortality was more frequent in downy brome grass as the host plants matured. Mortality of late-instar larvae late in the season was signiÞcantly higher in mature downy brome grass than in mature wheat stems. The weight of these late-instar larvae from wheat was almost four-fold heavier than larvae from downy brome grass. Stem height and seed weight in wheat were signiÞcantly reduced by larval sawßies feeding. In contrast, stem height, stem diameter, seed weight, and seed number in grass stems were signiÞcantly greater in infested downy brome grass stems compared with uninfested plants. Our results suggest that downy brome grass, a serious weed in wheat cropping, may play an important role in the survival and dynamics of wheat stem sawßy populations in the northern Great Plains.},

   abstract = { The effects of the major factors on populations of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, were studied in the field at Lethbridge, Alberta between 1970 and 1977. Fecundity of the females, which contain an average of 32.7 eggs, is influenced by the condition and variety of host plants in which they develop as larvae. Populations of the adults that emerge from infested crops cut 7–9% by the larvae in one year may infest 70–80% of the stems of adjacent crops in the following year. Increased adult densities, however, fail to increase markedly the percentage of stems infested because the adults concentrate at field margins when they reinfest the most preferred stems. Because only one larva can mature in each stem, competition within stems that receive more than one egg causes a major drop in the population but not in the percentage of infested stems cut. Another major drop is caused by host plant resistance, which is influenced in both susceptible and resistant wheats by the weather during the growing season. On an average, all of the larvae die in 28% of the infested stems of two susceptible wheats and in 67% of those of a resistant wheat. The mortality in resistant wheats, however, is generally not sufficient to prevent economic infestations in subsequent years. Parasitism, which was a major factor in only 7 of 36 years in southern Alberta, is increased by weather conditions that cause delayed ripening of the wheat crops. The mortality of mature larvae and pupae averaged 21.3%. It is affected by extremes of moisture and temperature and can be increased slightly by shallow tillage of infested stubble. },

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is the most serious insect pest of dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; Poaceae) in the southern Canadian Prairies and the northern Great Plains of the United States. We characterized the spatial distribution pattern of C. cinctus eggs and larvae throughout the adult flight period in three dryland winter wheat fields in Montana. Cephus cinctus females laid eggs in wheat stems until a few weeks before wheat maturity, and most wheat stems received only one egg. Wheat stem samples collected along the field edges represented 12%-16% of the samples but 40%-95% of the infested stems. The highest numbers of C. cinctus eggs and larvae found in a single wheat stem were 16 and 4, respectively. On a field scale, both C. cinctus eggs and larvae were significantly aggregated along field edges in most of the sampling events. A comparison of indices of aggregation revealed that C. cinctus larvae were significantly more spatially aggregated than C. cinctus eggs. Based on our spatiotemporal analysis, we speculate that the majority of the eggs are initially laid along field edges, and ovipositing C. cinctus females do not distinguish between previously infested and uninfested wheat stems. Gradually, these eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding; at the same time, the later emerging C. cinctus females oviposit farther into the wheat fields. One explanation is that ovipositing C. cinctus females avoid stems containing feeding larvae. The analysis of the temporal changes in the spatial distribution patterns of C. cinctus eggs and larvae is discussed in the context of possible integrated pest management strategies. © 2005 Entomological Society of Canada.},

   abstract = {Insect herbivores typically oviposit on the most suitable hosts, but choices can be modulated by detection of potential competition among conspeciÞcs, especially when eggs are deposited cryptically. Larvae of the wheat stem sawßy, Cephus cinctus Norton, developing within an already infested stem, experience elevated risk when only one will survive because of cannibalism. To increase our understanding of host selection when the choices made by females can lead to severe intraspeciÞc competition, females were presented with either uninfested wheat plants or with plants previously exposed to other females in laboratory choice tests. The oviposition behavior of this insect was described by recording the behavioral sequences that lead to and follow the insertion of the ovipositor in both previously infested and uninfested stems. No signiÞcant differences were found in frequencies of speciÞc behaviors or behavioral transitions associated with oviposition. In choice tests, there was no difference in the numbers of eggs laid in infested and uninfested plants. Taller plants received more eggs, irrespective of infestation. Females neither preferred nor avoided previously infested hosts. Other characteristics of the host, such as stem height, may be more important in determining suitability for oviposition. These Þndings support the use of management tactics relying on the manipulation of oviposition behavior, such as trap cropping. Given that there is no evidence for response to previously infested hosts, the infested plants in a trap crop would remain as suitable as they were when uninfested, which could also lead to an increase in mortality caused by intraspeciÞc competition.},

We found that rates of parasitism of larvae in diapause chambers reached a maximum of 46%, exceeding the previously reported maximum of 2.5% in 75% of sites and years examined. In contrast to previous work, our results demonstrate that C. cinctus larvae are suitable hosts for braconid parasitoids, even after the formation of diapause chambers, and suggest that parasitism rates may be underestimated if stems are sampled prior to harvest.},

   abstract = {The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is a key pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America. Host plant resistance in the form of solid-stemmed wheat cultivars is the main control strategy for C. cinctus. This study investigated the effect of novel and traditional solid wheat hosts on the overwintering mortality and cold-hardiness of C. cinctus. Field conditions from 2003-2005 showed that overwintering mortality in various wheat cultivars averaged 8% and was not related to the type of wheat cultivar. Similarly, supercooling points (-22° C) were not influenced by wheat host type. C. cintus are cold-hardy; up to 80% survive 10 days at-20° C and 10% survive 40 days. Its overwintering microhabitat near the crown area of the plant is well insulated for temperatures above-10° C and remains ~ 20° C above ambient minima. These data suggest that winter mortality is a minor factor in the population dynamics of wheat stem sawfly, and despite clear detrimental effects on larval weight and adult fitness, solid-stemmed cultivars do not reduce the ability of larvae to survive winters.},
